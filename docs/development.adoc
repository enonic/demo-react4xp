|production
|production
a|
Pros:

* comes with every starter
* you test what runs in production

Cons:

* takes a [red]#long# time to build
* debugging could be [red]#hard#

Notes:

* it should minimize assets and generate map files
|production
|development
| Basically the same as the previous one

|dev
|production
a|

Pros:

* should build [yellow]#somewhat quickly#
* useful when [green]#debugging#

Cons:

* incremental/watch [yellow]#MUST# be done by Gradle since a fresh jar file is needed
* browserSync [yellow]#MUST#  watch build/resources/main

Notes:

* it should not waste time minimizing assets nor generate map files

|dev
|dev
a|

Pros:

* should build [green]#VERY quickly#
* useful when [green]#debugging#
* incremental/watch [green]#can# be done by Node since a the old jar file can be used
* browserSync [green]#can# watch src/main/resources

Notes:

* if code is changed in src/main/java a fresh jar file is still needed
* it should not waste time minimizing assets nor generate map files
