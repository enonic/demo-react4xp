[[api]]
The react4xp library (link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-lib[Enonic Market]) exposes a couple of methods that can be run from XP controllers.


== Install
Instructions on how to install the library locally or insert it into your project are at link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp#readme[the library docs] at github.

== Import library

.In an XP controller:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');
----

{zwsp} +

[[react4xp_render]]
== React4xp.render

All-in-one (static) shorthand function for a lot of use cases. Covers both client- and serverside rendering.

Inserts a react component into an (optional) pre-existing HTML string and adds any necessary page contributions to make all work: links to assets, both shared and specific to the entry, and a client-side JS call (`.render` or `.hydrate` in the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client[client wrapper]) that activates the react component in the browser.

{zwsp} +

==== Signature

The signature is analogous to thymeleaf's familiar `render(view, model)`. But there are two extra parameters, and a full XP response object is returned:

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
{body, pageContributions} = React4xp.render(entry, props, request, options);
----

{zwsp} +

[[react4xp_render_parameters]]
==== Parameters

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Name   | Type   | Description
| `entry` | string or component object, mandatory | Reference to an <<entries#, entry>>: the react component to be rendered. <<jsxpath#, JsxPath>> reference - or if the entry is a JSX file with the _same name_ in the _same folder_ as the controller, you can use a `portal.getComponent()` object here. Corresponds to the template argument in `thymeleaf.render`.
| `props` | object, optional | Data model passed into the react component. JS object must be serializable (no functions can be passed). Corresponds to the model argument in `thymeleaf.render`.
| `request` | link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP request object], optional (but _mandatory for react activation_) | Include to detect the rendering mode inside/outside Content Studio: inside Content Studio there should be only a static serverside-rendering, no browser react activation (or client-side rendering), only returning get an HTML visualization with the initial `props`. Special case: if `request` is not an object but omitted/falsy, page-contributions rendering is _completely skipped_. In this case, the _options_ argument (below) is still valid: any added `body` there will still serve as a container for the rendered output from this call, and any `pageContributions` inside _options_ are still added and returned.

| `options` | object, optional | Additional options to control the rendering. All of them are optional within this object:

[%header,cols="1%,1%,1%,96%a"]
[frame="topbot"]
[grid="none"]
[caption=""]
.Properties
!===
! Name        ! Type   ! Default ! Description
! `id` ! string ! Unique string (random) !  ID of the component, targeting the ID of an element in `body` (below): react will render into that container element. Should be a unique ID within the entire HTML document.

If no matching element ID is found in `body`, this sets the ID of a generated element in the HTML output. If `id` is missing, a unique ID is generated, either random or generated from the content.
! `body` ! string: valid HTML ! `<div>` with matching `id` ! HTML to serve as container for the react content. Can be a hardcoded string, come from a thymeleaf/mustache/XSLT render, or any source.  When server-side rendering, the rendered output will be inserted into the matching-`id` element inside here (replacing whatever was already in that element), and everything (container `body` with rendered content in it) is returned as one HTML string. When client-side rendering, this insertion happens in the browser.

If no `body` is supplied, an empty `<div>` element with an ID matching `id` is generated and used as container.

If a `body` is supplied but it doesn't contain any element with a matching `id`, an extra matching-`id` `<div>` element will be generated and inserted into `body` - as a child of the root element of `body` and after any other content that's already there.
! `pageContributions` ! object: valid link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions] ! ! If you already have some page contributions you want to add to the output of this rendering, add them here. These added page contributions will be added _before_ the ones that will be rendered (within each section `headBegin`, `bodyEnd` etc).
! `clientRender` ! boolean ! false ! Switch between clientside and servierside rendering, on this particular rendering. Other renderings are not affected, even within the same controller or using the same entry more than once.

If `false` / falsy or omitted, you get serverside rendering and the returned object will contain an HTML representation of the react component with the initial `props`, and page contributions will make the client call `.hydrate`.

If `true` / truthy, the server-side rendering is skipped for this particular rendering. The client will call `.render`.

This *only applies in live mode and previews*: inside _edit_ or _browse_ modes in Content Studio, you still only get a static server-side rendered representation).

==== Returns

Returns an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP response object] with these main attributes:

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Attribute   | Type   | Description
| `body` | string, rendered HTML | HTML output.

The root of this HTML is always a *surrounding container* HTML that will have a matching-ID *target element* in it somewhere (an element matching the ID of the clientside call to `.render` or `.hydrate`: that ID is `options.id` if that was set, or a generated unique one if not). This surrounding structure is `options.body`, unchanged if that already contained a matching-ID element, or with a new target element generated and inserted at the end if it didnâ€™t have one. If there is no `options.body`, the surrounding container is just a generated target `<div>` element.

Inside that matching-ID element, there will be a serverside rendering of the entry (with the initial props from `options.props`) if `options.clientRender` is falsy.
| `pageContributions`| object | Regular link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions]. Includes everything the browser needs to activate (or client-side render) the react component: script tags with urls to auto-compiled assets for the entry and its dependencies, a client-side react4xp wrapper asset and an activating client-wrapper call. Urls point to react4xp's own optimized asset services. Also included before this, are any input `options.pageContributions`.

==== Examples

Most of the lessons in the guide use `React4xp.render` (except the "custom flow" ones). For example <<hello-react#first_helloreact_jsx, here>> or <<pages-parts-and-regions#color_part_controller, here>>.

== React4xp object

More cumbersome than `React4xp.render`, but also more flexible and controllable, is creating a data-holding react4xp object with the React4xp contructor, manipulating it or extracting data from it, and then render it to an HTML body string and/or page contributions, separately (it's actually what `React4xp.render` does behind the scenes).

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[constructor]]
=== Constructor

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const myComponent = new React4xp(entry);
----

Creates an initial object from an entry.

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `entry` | string or component object, mandatory | Reference to an <<entries#, entry>>: the react component to be rendered. Direct <<jsxpath#, JsxPath>> string, or a `portal.getComponent()` object. If you use a component object like that, the entry must be a JSX file with the _same name_ in the _same folder_ as the controller, and react4xp will try to generate an ID from the content.
|===

*Constructs* a react4xp data object, which exposes the attributes and methods below:

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

=== Main object attributes

Extract from the object the data that has been generated or set in it.

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Name   | Type   | Description
| `react4xpId` | string | Target `id` of the HTML element the entry will be rendered into (if it's been set yet - see `setId` and `uniqueId` below). Also identifies the object.
| `jsxPath` | string | <<jsxpath#, jsxPath>> to the entry.
| `props` | object | `props` for the entry's initial rendering. At the time of rendering, an attribute `react4xpId` is added to the props, allowing each entry to access its own unique ID at runtime.
|===

.Example:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const targetElementId = myComponent.react4xpId;
----

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[setter_methods]]
=== Setter methods

Use these to set the object's properties. All of them are optional; if not used, the object will render with empty values or placeholders where needed, along the same logic as for <<#react4xp_render, React4xp.render>> above.

All the setter methods *return* the data object itself, so that you can use a *builder pattern* where...

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.firstSetter("a").secondSetter("b").thirdSetter("c");
----

...is equivalent to:

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.firstSetter("a");
myComponent.secondSetter("b");
myComponent.thirdSetter("c");
----

The order between the setters doesn't matter, with the exception if `setId` and `uniqueId` which affect each other.

{zwsp} +

==== .setProps

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.setProps(props);
----

Sets props for the entry.

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `props` | object, mandatory | `props` passed into the react component for initial rendering. JS object must be serializable (no functions can be passed).
|===

{zwsp} +

[[set_id]]
==== .setId

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.setId(id);
----

Sets an ID (directly and literally, so uniqueness is up to you) of both the target HTML element for rendering the entry into, and the ID of the data object itself (`react4xpId`). If `renderBody()` is run later without finding a matching element ID in `body`, this sets the ID of a generated element in the HTML output.

If the data object already has an ID, `.setId(id)` will overwrite it. If `id` is omitted, `.setId()` just deletes any previous ID (which has the later effect of giving this a new, unique ID at the time of rendering).

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `id` | string, optional |  ID of both the target HTML element and the data object itself.
|===

{zwsp} +

==== .uniqueId

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.uniqueId();
----

Enforces a unique ID, either by itself or after running `.setId()`. If the object already has an ID (`react4xpId`), a random-ID string will be added to it. If not, the ID will just be a new random ID.

No parameters.

{zwsp} +

==== .setJsxPath

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
myComponent.setJsxPath(jsxPath);
----

If you for some reason need to override the JsxPath that was set (or inferred from the component object) in the constructor.

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `jsxPath` | string, mandatory |  New <<jsxpath#, jsxPath>> to a different entry.
|===

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +


=== Rendering methods

These methods perform specific rendering tasks independently, using the data object as a basis, the way it's set up with the <<#setter_methods, setters>> and with the entry from the <<#constructor, constructor>> (or the `setJsxPath` setter).

NOTE: Most of these rendering methods will lock down the jsxPath and ID if the react4xp data object, the first time one of them is run. After this, the setters will prevent these from being changed so that another conflicting rendering can't be performed from the same data object.

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[render_body]]
==== .renderBody

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const responseBody = myComponent.renderBody(options);
----

Similar to <<#react4xp_render, React4xp.render>> above, but renders _only_ a static HTML output.

Renders based on the state of the data object at the time of rendering, and with fewer `option` parameters than `React4xp.render`.

The static HTML will always contain a target element for rendering the entry into. That target element contains a serverside rendering of the entry if serverside is switched on (`clientRender` is falsy).

[NOTE]
====
Does _not_ render page contributions. Run `.renderPageContributions` from the same data object, or the rendering will not be active in the browser.
====

*Parameters:*

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `options` | object, optional | Options to control the rendering, all of them optional:

[%header,cols="1%,1%,4%,93%a"]
[frame="topbot"]
[grid="none"]
[caption=""]
.Properties
!===
! Name        ! Type   ! Default ! Description
! `body` ! string: valid HTML ! `<div>` with matching `id` (same as `react4xpId` in the data object) ! Same as the `options.body` in <<#react4xp_render_parameters, React4xp.render>> above.
! `clientRender` ! boolean ! false ! Switch between clientside and serverside rendering, on this particular rendering.

Other renderings are not affected, _even from the same data object_ (so you usually want to make sure a different rendering from the same data object uses the same mode).
!===

|===


*Returns*:

Returns an HTML string ready to return as the `body` attribute in an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http#http-response[XP response object] from the controller.

The root of the returned HTML is always a *surrounding container* HTML that will have a matching-ID *target element* in it somewhere (an element matching the data object's ID (`react4xpId`), either from the <<#set_id, ID setter methods>>, or a generated ID if they haven't been run). This surrounding structure is `options.body`, unchanged if that already contained a matching-ID element, or with a new target element generated and inserted at the end if it didn't have one. If there is no `options.body`, the surrounding container is just a generated target element.

Inside that matching-ID element, there will be a serverside rendering of the entry (with the initial props from `.setProps`) if `options.clientRender` is falsy.

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

==== .renderPageContributions

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const outputPageContributions = myComponent.renderPageContributions(options);
----

Similar to <<#react4xp_render, React4xp.render>> above, but _only_ renders the page contributions needed to run and activate the react component in the browser. Whether the trigger call is `.render` or `.hydrate` depends on if `options.clientRender` is truthy or falsy, respectively.

Renders based on the state of the data object at the time of rendering, and with fewer `option` parameters than `React4xp.render`.

[NOTE]
====
Does _not_ render any HTML. Run `.renderBody` from the same data object, or the browser may have nothing to activate / nowhere to render the entry.

Also, there is *no detection of inside-vs-outside Content Studio*, and consequently the client is _not_ prevented from running client-side code in Content Studio. That is not recommended, see the examples for how to handle this.
====

*Parameters:*

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `options` | object, optional | Options to control the rendering, all of them optional:

[%header,cols="1%,1%,4%,93%a"]
[frame="topbot"]
[grid="none"]
[caption=""]
.Properties
!===
! Name        ! Type   ! Default ! Description
! `pageContributions` ! object: valid link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions]  ! empty object ! If you already have some page contributions you want to add to the output of this rendering, add them here. These added page contributions will be added _before_ the ones that will be rendered (within each section `headBegin`, `bodyEnd` etc).
! `clientRender` ! boolean ! false ! Switch between clientside and servierside rendering, on this particular rendering.

Other renderings are not affected, _even from the same data object_ (so you usually want to make sure a different rendering from the same data object uses the same mode).
!===

|===

*Returns:*

A regular link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions] object, ready to be used as the `pageContributions` attribute in an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http#http-response[XP response object] from the controller.

Includes everything the browser needs to activate (or client-side render) the react component: script tags with urls to auto-compiled assets for the entry and its dependencies, a link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client[client-side react4xp wrapper asset] and an activating trigger call to the client wrapper. Urls point to react4xp's own optimized asset services. Also included before this, are any input `options.pageContributions`.

With a serverside rendering (`options.clientRender` is falsy), the client will expect an existing target element with a pre-rendered entry in the response `body`, and call `react4xp.CLIENT.hydrate`. If `options.clientRender` is truthy, an empty target element is expected in the response `body`, and the rendering is left to the client with `react4xp.CLIENT.render`.

{zwsp} +

==== .renderEntryToHtml

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const entryHTML = myComponent.renderEntryToHtml(overrideProps);
----

Helper rendering tool, for utility purposes.

Pure serverside rendering of the entry to a static HTML string, without any surrounding HTML, target container or anything, just the entry.

[%header,cols="1%,1%,98%a"]
[frame="none"]
[grid="none"]
|===
| Parameter   | Type   | Description
| `overrideProps` | object, optional | If omitted, the data object's own props (from `.setProps`, if it's been run) are used for the rendering. If `overrideProps` are included, however, the data object's own props are ignored, and `overrideProps` used instead.

JS object must be serializable (no functions can be passed).
|===

*Returns* a static HTML representation of the entry.
