= Editorial content and props
:toc: right

In this chapter we'll have a closer look at how content may be passed to your React component via props.


== Content type

To create some interesting content, start off by adding a new content type. To stay on topic, we'll call the new content type `Pub`.

Add the following file to your app:

./src/main/resources/site/content-types/pub/pub.xml:
[source,xml]
----
include::../src/main/resources/site/content-types/pub/pub.xml[]
----

== Controller
Next, we'll modify our controller. It needs to fetch the content, and pass it as `props` to the React component:

[[controller_with_props]]
.react4xp/hello-react.ts:
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/react4xp/hello-react.ts[]
----
<1> We'll use a new React component this time
<2> Fetches the contextual content
<3> The `props` object is just any standard *serializable* JS object
<4> Pass the props to the component

=== Hello props component
Finally, add a new React template that makes use of the props object.

.react4xp/entries/hello-props.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::../src/main/resources/react4xp/entries/hello-props.tsx[]
----

[TIP]
====
`props` are of course the standard react way to do this. It all is. As long as a _props => reactComponent_ function is default-exported, React4xp accepts standard valid TSX/JSX/TS/JS/ES6.

Although, if you think that the _makeObjectDropper_ closure thing is a strange way to do something react itself could do better... sure. Just trying to stay focused on one thing at a time.

== Create a Pub

Setting up a new Pub has never been easier. Back in Content Studio, click new - and select `Pub`, which should now be available in the list of content you can create.

Fill in the form, and press save to see the glorious result.
