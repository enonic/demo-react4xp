Enonic provides a highly customizable component type called link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/pages/parts[parts^].

If you take a look at the person folder you might see something like this:

== Task: Add a part

We’ll start off by adding a simple component that lists child items in the tree structure.

. *Add the `child-list` component* to your application:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/parts/ChildList.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/parts/ChildList.tsx[]
----

. *Add the `child-list` processor* to your application:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/parts/ChildListProcessor.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/parts/ChildListProcessor.ts[]
----

. *Add the `child-list` CSS module* to your application:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/parts/ChildList.module.css
[source,CSS]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/parts/ChildList.module.css[]
----

. Add the `child-list` part to your *component registry and data fetcher*:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/componentRegistry.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}/parts/componentRegistry.tsx[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/dataFetcher.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}/parts/dataFetcher.ts[]
----

. *Now you should be able to see something like this:*
image:child-list-render.png[title="Child list part",width=720px]
+
Try updating it by customizing the page and changing order, adding or removing items in the tree structure.

== Bonus task: Heading

Since we are working with react4XP and not guillotine, we should have a head.

Add a heading to the page

. *Add the `heading` component* to your application:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/parts/Heading.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/parts/Heading.tsx[]
----
. *Add the `heading` processor* to your application:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/parts/HeadingProcessor.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/parts/HeadingProcessor.ts[]
----
+
Since we are using globalStyles.css to style the heading, we don’t need to add a CSS module for it.
. *Add the `heading` part to your component registry and data fetcher*:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/componentRegistry.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}/parts/componentRegistry.tsx[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/dataFetcher.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}/parts/dataFetcher.ts[]
----
. *Now you should be able to see something like this:*
image:header.png[title="Heading part",width=720px]

In the next chapter you will make page composition even more interesting, with the introduction of <<layouts#, layouts>>.
