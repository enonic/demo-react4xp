Content types are nice, but letting the editors compose their own pages is even better.


== Intro

By defining a page, editors may drag'n drop cms components into the page, visually.

== Set up page rendering

Content types are required before an editor can create content.
Similarly, pages components must be defined before they can create pages.

. *Add the component files*:

./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/page/Page.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/page/Page.tsx[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/page/PageProcessor.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/page/PageProcessor.ts[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/page/Page.module.css
[source,CSS]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/page/Page.module.css[]
----

. *Register the processor and component*:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/dataFetcher.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}pages/dataFetcher.ts[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/componentRegistry.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}pages/componentRegistry.tsx[]
----
+

== Working with pages

As it turns out, HMDB already contains data for pages, and by reloading your front-page, you should immediately see this:

=== The text component

The reason why you can see the righ text content on the page, is that Content Studio ships with a `Rich text component` that can be placed on pages. React4XP also implements a default rendering of this.

Try editing the page, to see how this works.

=== Movies

TODO: Verify

Visiting the `Movies` page, you will components that are missing rendering. Content Studio has a built-in fallback handling for thse, so you can interact with them, even if they are not yet rendering.

We'll deal with some of these in the <<parts#,parts>> chapter.
