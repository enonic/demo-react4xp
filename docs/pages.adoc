Structured content is nice. Letting editors compose pages adds another dimention.


== Intro

By defining a page component, editors may start building pages.

== Set up page rendering

Content types are required before an editor can create content. Similarly, pages components must be defined before they can create pages.

. *Add the component files*:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/page/Page.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/page/Page.tsx[]
----
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/page/Page.module.css
[source,CSS]
----
include::{sourcedir}react4xp/components/page/Page.module.css[]
----

. *Update the componentRegistry*
+
./src/main/resources/componentRegistry.tsx
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}pages/componentRegistry.tsx[]
----
+
NOTE: Here we also disabled the "Hello" component, as it is no longer needed.
+
. *Disable the HelloProcessor* as well:
+
Your dataFetcher should now look like this:
+
./src/main/resources/react4xp/dataFetcher.ts
[source,TypeScript]
----
include::{snippet}pages/dataFetcher.ts[]
----
+


== Working with pages

The HMDB dataset already contains sample content with pages. By selecting the front-page in Content Studio, you should immediately see something like this:

image:r4xp-demo.png[title="First page rendering with text component",width=1390px]

By editing the front page, you will see that a page with a single region `main`, containing a single Text Component.

=== The Text Component

Enonic provides a standard `Rich text component` that can be placed on pages. React4XP implements a default rendering of this special component.

By selecting the component, in the list, or directly on the page you can start editing it.

=== Custom components

Pages also support custom components. Try selecting the `Movies` page, and you will see that some components are not rendering properly. Content Studio has a built-in fallback handling for these, so you can interact with them, even if they are not yet rendering.

We'll start dealing with this in the <<parts#,parts>> chapter.
