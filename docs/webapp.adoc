[TIP]
====
This chapter builds on the source code from <<guillotine#, the previous chapter>>, especially the entry and dependencies, and the assets that they're compiled into.

If you've completed that lesson, nice. But that code is not in focus here and we won't look at it much - what we'll build in this chapter is _around_ the compiled assets from entries and dependencies, just referring to them.

*What counts here are the general principles and usage patterns*. They should become pretty clear pretty soon.
====

{zwsp} +

== Intro

=== The story so far

Until now in all the previous examples, the XP controllers have still been at the center of the rendering.

Even in the <<guillotine#, previous chapter>>, which demonstrated how to make the frontend react components render with data fetched from an API, the response from the initial request to the page still came from an XP controller.

In that response there was a serverside-rendered initial HTML rendering of the entry, references to dependency and entry assets (in the right order), and a client-side wrapper (fetched from a referred XP service) that handles the react rendering/hydration trigger in the browser. All of this was automatically generated and included from the `React4xp.render` call in the XP controller.

{zwsp} +

=== Going fully headless

But in general, when the react4xp buildtime compiles the react component source files (etc) into assets, what happens is just a *regular webpack* process that generates *regular JS (etc) assets* that can be run in the browser in pretty much any regular way - independent of the react4xp runtime.

*In other words, you can serve the react4xp-compiled assets from anywhere and use them however you want.*

Now that we've seen how to set up an API that serves XP content data, and that using that data to render something with react in the browser boils down to passing props and handling a component state, this opens up for *headless approaches!*

[[nutshell]]
== Standalone react4xp in a nutshell

The takeaway of this chapter is this: react4xp components (entries and dependencies) can be used without any XP controller or `React4xp.render` call. To do that, the base HTML (the response of a first page request, or some script loaded by it) *must do these tasks*:

<1> Load React and ReactDOM from somewhere. For example a CDN,
<2> Load all the <<chunks#, dependency chunks>> that the entries need (before loading the entry assets!),
<3> Load all <<entries#, entry assets>>. This will make each entry available in the browser's JS namespace as a react-component-creating function, at `React4xp[jsxPath].default`, for each entry's <<jsxPath#, jsxPath>>.
<4> Construct a props object for each entry that uses props. This is where we'll contact the <<guillotine#expose_api, guillotine endpoint>> in this lesson, for fetching the data from XP.
<5> Use the props with each entry's component-creating function to create a react-renderable component:
+
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const component = React4xp[jsxPath].default(props);
----
<6> Finally, render the component into your DOM:
+
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
ReactDOM.render(component, document.getElementById("my-target-container-id"));
----

If you've used react before, this is the same flow.

{zwsp} +

NOTE: *This approach does NOT include server-side react rendering!* At least not out of the box. But since the react4xp build processes are pretty regular webpack, using regular react, it should be perfectly possible to tweak things and engineer your own solutions. If you go down that path, using Node.js instead of Nashorn for the SSR engine might be easier - Nashorn needs more polyfilling.

== Lesson overview

We'll take a look at *two variations* of how to use react4xp-compiled components without rendering them from XP controllers. Both of them do <<#nutshell, the same steps above>>, in slightly different ways:

{zwsp} +

<1> *Completely standalone:* this first variation is the manual, hardcoded, vanilla-js-and-react webapp approach. The HTML and script do everything explicitly: asset URLs and initial values are *handled and organized manually in the HTML itself*, and the script at the end fetches data from guillotine, organizes them into props and makes a *regular `ReactDOM.render` call*. In this approach, XP's role is mainly to serve content data through the guillotine API. Pretty independent but there are no helpers; so getting things right is up to you.
+
{zwsp} +
<2> *Webapp with XP helpers:* this second variation is "slightly standalone": we use XP to wrap a little boilerplate for convenience: *XP and thymeleaf provides some initial values*. The script at the end is still loaded and used to fetch data and create props, but instead of having the HTML load all the entry and dependency assets and call `React4xp.render`, the react4xp client wrapper is loaded in order to use a *react4xp helper function:* `.renderWithDependencies`. This is an all-in-one rendering trigger that takes one or more <<jsxPath#, entry jsxPaths>> with props and target container ID's, and uses *XP services* for auto-tracking and loading all the assets needed (including dependency chunks) before rendering them.

{zwsp} +

Keep in mind that except for the XP services in the second variation, *no running XP is strictly necessary for this to work*. The data-serving endpoint could be any API (e.g. REST) instead of guillotine, and the initial HTML and JS/CSS assets are static and could be served from anywhere. Use whatever approach suits your project.

But we'll use XP anyway in this chapter: we already have it up and running from the previous chapters. So we'll use link:https://developer.enonic.com/guides/my-first-webapp[the XP webapp functionality] (see link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/webapp-engine[here] for more documentation) to serve the initial HTML, and the link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/runtime/engines/asset-service[regular XP asset functionality] for serving the assets for the entries and dependencies.

{zwsp} +

=== Source files

.Files involved (src/main/resources/...) - in addition to <<guillotine#chapter_source_files, the ones from chapter 8>>:
[source,files]
----
webapp/
    webapp.es6
    webapp.html

assets/webapp/
    script.es6
----

XP uses _webapp.es6_ and _webapp.html_ to generate an initial HTML that directly makes the browser run most of <<#nutshell, the steps above>>, fetching assets and setting up initial values, and then calling the final _script.es6_ asset, which handles the rest.

== 1. Completely standalone

In this first of the two approaches, we'll minimize the use of runtime XP: all values and asset URLs are hardcoded. XP is used to serve the initial HTML and the assets, as well as providing a guillotine endpoint where the browser can fetch data, but this functionality can easily be replaced with any other file- and data-serving solution and still work just fine.

[[html1]]
=== HTML base

The webapp begins with some basic HTML, setting it all up in the browser.

.webapp.html:
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Completely standalone</title>


        <!--1-->
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
        <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>

        <!--2-->
        <script src="(...) /react4xp/shared.d366a6c1b.js"></script>
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="(...) /react4xp/shared.5440dda80.css" />
        <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="(...) /react4xp/MovieList.css" />

        <!--3-->
        <script src="(...) /react4xp/MovieList.js"></script>

        <style>
            body { margin: 0; padding: 0; }
            h1, p, .faux-spinner { padding: 30px; margin: 0 auto; font-family: 'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; }
        </style>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>Top 3 movies to put in a list</h1>
        <p>#4 will blow your mind!</p>

        <!--4-->
        <div id="movieListContainer">
            <div class="faux-spinner">Loading movies...</div>
        </div>

        <!--5-->
        <script>
            var MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS= {
                parentPath: '/moviesite',
                apiUrl: '/admin/site/preview/default/draft/moviesite/api/headless',
                movieType: 'com.enonic.app.react4xp:movie',
                movieCount: 3,
                sortExpression: 'data.year ASC',
            };
        </script>

        <!--6-->
        <script defer src="(...) /webapp/script.js"></script>
    </body>
</html>

----
<1> We start by running React and ReactDOM from a CDN.
<2> Next, we fetch 3 dependency chunks that the _MovieList_ entry needs: _shared.&lt;hash&gt;.js_, _shared.&lt;hash&gt;.css_ and _MovieList.css_.
+
[NOTE]
====
As before, these are asset URLs that depend on your setup - and this applies to both the *content-dependent &lt;hash&gt;* in the filename and the *asset path* itself. On my local machine running XP, the path (the `(...)` before _/react4xp/..._) is this:

`/webapp/com.enonic.app.react4xp/_/asset/com.enonic.app.react4xp:1604314030`

If you've run through the previous chapter, you can for example copy the corresponding asset-URLs from the produced page source HTML in the preview.
====
<3> The _MovieList_ entry asset. Loading and running this will expose the entry in the global JS namescape as a function that creates a react component: `React4xp['MovieList'].default`.
<4> The target container for the react app. The not-really-a-spinner (_"Loading movies..."_) will be replaced when the actual _MovieList_ is rendered into the container.
<5> Variables used by our particular script later, just wrapped in a `MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS` object to encapsulate them in the global namespace. These are the same values as in in the previous chapter, and the script at the end will use these in a `props` object, to create the renderable react app from the _MovieList_ entry.
+
Also note that we just hardcoded the values of `parentPath`, `apiUrl` and `movieType` here - they may be different in your setup. As <<guillotine#, before>>: `parentPath` is the content path of the site item under which the movie items will be found, `apiUrl` is the full path to `/api/headless` _below that site_ (recall that the URL to the guillotine API depends on the URL of a site item like this, because of the way we set the API up with a controller mapping <<guillotine#expose_api, earlier>>), and `movietype` is the full, appname-dependent content type of the movie items to look for.
<6> Finally, loading the compiled script from _script.es6_ <<#script, below>>.

{zwsp} +

A *webapp controller* is needed for XP to serve this HTML, and it's about as minimal as an XP controller can be:

.webapp.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import thymeleaf from '/lib/thymeleaf';
const view = resolve('webapp.html');

exports.get = () => ({
        contentType: 'text/html',
        body: thymeleaf.render(view, {})
});
----

{zwsp} +

[[script]]
=== The script

Finally, the script that's called at the end of the HTML.

If you've been through the lesson in the <<guillotine#, previous chapter>>, you might recognize that these functions are mostly the same code as was used in that chapter, just copied into one asset (if you haven't, just see that chapter for reference).

The main function is `requestAndRenderMovies`. It gets its input values from the `MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS` object we defined in the global namespace in the HTML earlier, then uses these to request data about 3 (`movieCount`) movies (`movieType`) under the _movielist_ site (`parentPath`), from the guillotine API. Just like in the previous chapter, the guillotine query string for fetching movies is built with a function, `buildQueryListMovies`. The returned data is parsed into a JSON array of movie objects (`extractToMovieArray`) and passed to the `renderMovie` function, where it's used in a `props` object alongside other values from `MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS`. Along with the `props`, the _MovieList_ entry (`React4xp['MovieList]`) is used to create a renderable react component that is rendered into the target `movieListContainer` element in the DOM with `ReactDOM.render`, now as a top-level react app.


.script.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const buildQueryListMovies = (movieType, parentPath) => {
    const matched = movieType.match(/(\w+(\.\w+)*):(\w+)/i);  // verifies content type names like "com.enonic.app.react4xp:movie" and matches up groups before and after the colon
    if (!matched) {
        throw Error(`movieType '${movieType}' is not a valid format. Expecting <appName>:<XP content type>, for example: 'com.enonic.app.react4xp:movie' etc`);
    }
    const appNameUnderscored = matched[1].replace(/\./g, '_');      // e.g. "com.enonic.app.react4xp" --> "com_enonic_app_react4xp
    const ctyCapitalized = matched[3][0].toUpperCase() + matched[3].substr(1);       // e.g. "movie" --> "Movie"

    return `
query($first:Int!, $offset:Int!, $sort:String!) {
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: ["${movieType}"], query: "_parentPath = '/content${parentPath}'", first: $first, offset: $offset, sort: $sort) {
      ... on ${appNameUnderscored}_${ctyCapitalized} {
        _id
        displayName
        data {
          year
          description
          actor
          image {
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "width(300)")
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`;
};

// Not using util-lib to ensure usability on frontend
const forceArray = maybeArray => Array.isArray(maybeArray)
    ? maybeArray

            id: movieItem._id,
            title: movieItem.displayName.trim(),

[[output1]]
=== Output

Assuming you've been through the <<guillotine#, previous lesson>>, you can now rebuild the project. But instead of opening Content Studio, open the XP main menu in the top right corner, choose _Applications_, and in the Applications viewer, select your app:

image:webapp_applications.png[title="Select your app in the Applications viewer", width=1024px]

{zwsp}

At the bottom of the app info panel, you'll see a URL where you can preview the webapp we just built:

image:webapp_url.png[title="URL to preview the webapp.", width=1024px]

{zwsp}

Clicking this link should now show you the working webapp - listing 3 initial movies and filling in more as you scroll down, just like in the preview at the end of the previous chapter.

== 2. Webapp with XP helpers

This is all nice and well, but a cumbersome part is that it requires you to supply values and asset URLs yourself, or ways to figure them out. Hashes in file names is a neat way of content-based cache busting, but keeping track of the resulting file names can be a chore. Even if that's not an issue, it could be handy to have a way to just supply the name (jsxPath) of the entry (or entries) you want to render, and let the system itself figure out what dependency chunk(s) are needed to load alongside the entry asset(s). Not to mention prevent them from being downloaded twice.

If you have XP running but still want to make things work headlessly and outside of Content Studio, react4xp provides a couple of helpers for this. The client wrapper comes with the function `.renderWithDependencies`, which uses an XP service to track the sum set of dependency chunks required to render a set of jsxPaths, loads them and the entry assets, and renders them.

=== HTML base

The HTML base is very similar to the one in <<#html1, the previous example>>, only this time since we're using XP anyway, it's a more traditional link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/thymeleaf-library/master[thymeleaf template]. This means we can get rid of most of the hardcoded stuff in the HTML.

Just like before, we get react/react-dom from a CDN, provide a pinch of styling and a ready container to render into (with a "spinner". Whatever). But the differences are these:

.webapp.html:
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----

        <script data-th-utext="|
        var MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS= {
            serviceUrlRoot: '${portal.serviceUrl({'_service='})}',
            parentPath: '${sitePath}',
            apiUrl: '/admin/site/preview/default/draft${sitePath}/api/headless',
            movieType: '${movieType}',
            movieCount: 3,
            sortExpression: 'data.year ASC',
        }|"></script>

        <!--3-->
        <script defer data-th-src="${portal.assetUrl({'_path=webapp/script.js'})}"></script>
    </body>
</html>
----
<1> This is where we <<#html1, previously>> put hardcoded URLs to each specific dependency chunk and entry asset we want to use. Here, we only load the react4xp client-wrapper, and make it available in the browser’s namespace as `React4xp.CLIENT` (for more details, see link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client[the client wrapper docs on NPM]).
<2> As before, we set a few initial values for the final script to use. Two things are different here, though: first, we let the XP controller (right below) supply the appname-dependent content type and the content path to the site with the movies below it. And second: `serviceUrlRoot`. This value is the URL root of the XP services, and lets the script know where to look for the service that tracks the entries' assets and dependencies.
<3> The final script asset (<<#script2, below>>), also loaded by using the `portal.assetUrl` function with thymeleaf instead of hardcoded.

{zwsp} +

The *webapp controller* needs to provide that extra little info to the values in `MOVIE_LIST_PARAMS`, in the thymeleaf `model` now:

.webapp.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import thymeleaf from '/lib/thymeleaf';
const view = resolve('webapp.html');

exports.get = req => {
    const model = {
        sitePath:  "/moviesite",
        movieType: `${app.name}:movie`
    };

    return {
        contentType: 'text/html',
        body: thymeleaf.render(view, model)
    };
};
----

{zwsp} +

[[script2]]
=== The script asset

The script asset is almost identical to before. All that's changed is in `renderMovies` at the end:

.script.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const buildQueryListMovies = (movieType, parentPath) => {
    const matched = movieType.match(/(\w+(\.\w+)*):(\w+)/i);  // verifies content type names like "com.enonic.app.react4xp:movie" and matches up groups before and after the colon
    if (!matched) {
        throw Error(`movieType '${movieType}' is not a valid format. Expecting <appName>:<XP content type>, for example: 'com.enonic.app.react4xp:movie' etc`);
    }
    const appNameUnderscored = matched[1].replace(/\./g, '_');      // e.g. "com.enonic.app.react4xp" --> "com_enonic_app_react4xp
    const ctyCapitalized = matched[3][0].toUpperCase() + matched[3].substr(1);       // e.g. "movie" --> "Movie"

    return `
query($first:Int!, $offset:Int!, $sort:String!) {
  guillotine {
    query(contentTypes: ["${movieType}"], query: "_parentPath = '/content${parentPath}'", first: $first, offset: $offset, sort: $sort) {
      ... on ${appNameUnderscored}_${ctyCapitalized} {
        _id
        displayName
        data {
          year
          description
          actor
          image {
            ... on media_Image {
              imageUrl(type: absolute, scale: "width(300)")
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}`;
};

// Not using util-lib to ensure usability on frontend
const forceArray = maybeArray => Array.isArray(maybeArray)
    ? maybeArray
    : maybeArray
        ? [maybeArray]
        : [];


const extractMovieArray = responseData => responseData.data.guillotine.query
    .filter( movieItem => movieItem && typeof movieItem === 'object' && Object.keys(movieItem).indexOf('data') !== -1)

----
<1> No need to create the react components explicitly. As soon as the `props` are created, everything from there is handled by the `React4xp.CLIENT.renderWithDependencies` wrapper function (see link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client#renderwithdependencies[the react4xp client docs] for usage and details).

NOTE: This is where the `serviceUrlRoot` value is used - .renderWithDependencies` will not work without one!
