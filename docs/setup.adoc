= Setting up the developer environment
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/

Set up the developer environment, create, build, and deploy and application.

== Install Enonic CLI

The Enonic CLI (Command Line Interface) is an essential tool for developing with Enonic.

If you have `npm` on your device, run this command:

  npm install -g @enonic/cli

If not, here are some https://developer.enonic.com/start[alternative ways to install Enonic CLI^]

To verify that the CLI has been installed, run `enonic -v`. This should output the version of your installed CLI. To see all available options, simply run `enonic`.

TIP: To upgrade, use `enonic latest`. If there are new versions you will see instructions on how to upgrade.

== Create a sandbox

A sandbox is a local developer instance of our platform - Enonic XP. Each sandbox is isolated from the other ones and can run different versions of the platform.

. *Create a sandbox* called `r4xptutorial` by running this command in your terminal:
+
  enonic sandbox create r4xptutorial -t essentials -f
+
This will create a sandbox contaiing `essential` applications, and use the latest versjon of Enonic XP.
+
. **Start the sandbox** with this command:
+
  enonic sandbox start r4xptutorial --dev
+
This will start the sandbox.

TIP: --dev starts the sandbox in https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/development/build#dev_mode[development mode].

== Create the app

From a **new terminal window**, run the following command to create the application. 

  enonic project create -d r4xp -r starter-react4xp -sb r4xptutorial -f my.first.r4xp

[NOTE]
====
This command creates an app named `my.first.r4xp` in the folder `r4xp/`. It uses the https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp[React4xp starter^] Github repo as a template, and links it to the `r4xptutorial` sandbox. 
====

== Project structure

You will not get a typical Enonic project structure. The biggest news are `react4xp.config.js` and the folder `src/main/resources/react4xp/`.

[source,files]
----
build.gradle //<1>
package.json
react4xp.config.js // <2>
src/
  main/
    resources/
      react4xp/ // <3>
        entries/
        shared/
      site/ // <4>
----

<1> Core build files, will contain references to `lib-react4xp` library and the `@enonic/react4xp` npm package.
<2> React4xp <<appendix/build#, build configuration>>, here you may add additional globals and tune common React4xp properties.
<3> Optionally place React components in these folders. They will be covered in detail throughout the tutorial.
<4> Standard site/ folder

TIP: The short takeaqay is that you can put your TSX/JSX source files in `react4xp/entries/` or witin the `site/` structure directly.


== Start building

Assuming you did not change any of the values when creating the app, run the following commmands:

  cd r4xp
  enonic dev

This will build and deploy the application to your sandbox.

[NOTE]
====
Look for a line like this in the sandbox log to verify that the app has started:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [my.first.r4xp] installed successfully
====

Because the sandbox is running in dev mode, any changes to the code wihin your app will instantly be picked up.

Now you're ready to get started with the first lesson: <<hello-react#, Hello React>>.
