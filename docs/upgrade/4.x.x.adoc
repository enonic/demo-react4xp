= React4XP - Upgrade - 4.x.x
:toc: right

== What

=== Graal.JS

We have dropped support for Nashorn in favour of Graal.JS.

This means we had to upgrade the Enonic XP version requirement to 7.12

Since the Application Configuration setting `react4xp.ssr.settings` was only relevant for Nashorn, it has been removed.

And since React4xp now only supports Graal.JS: the Application Configuration setting `react4xp.ssr.engineName` is no longer relevant.

=== TypeScript

React4xp version 4 introduces support for TypeScript

* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enonic/react4xp/v/4.0.0-B1
* https://repo.enonic.com/service/rest/repository/browse/public/com/enonic/lib/lib-react4xp/4.0.0-B1
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enonic/react-components/v/3.1.2
* https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enonic-types/lib-react4xp/v/4.0.0-B2

=== React 18

React4xp will now use the new React 18 functions like createRoot() and hydrateRoot() if they are available.

If they are not, it will use the React 17 functions like render() and hydrate().

=== Target folder (browser cache)

We have changed target folder from `build/resources/main/assets/react4xp` to
`build/resources/main/r4xAssets`. The React4xp assets are currently provided by 
a service on top of lib-static and should not be available via assetUrl. When
building in production mode: the asset filenames contain contenthashes, so they
can be served as static assets with "infinite" browser caching. When building in
development mode, React4xp uses ETag.

We have not changed the source folder `src/main/resources/react4xp`, so you
don't have to move any files.

=== Named exports

The default export from '/lib/enonic/react4xp' used to be a class.
Now we are using named exports.
You can still import the class exported under the name React4xp.

=== clientRender (hydrate & ssr)

The clientRender option/parameter has been removed in favour of hydrate and ssr.

Read more under <<Application configuration>> and <<React4xp components>>

=== Globals vs Externals

We have added a new configuration option to PROJECT_DIR/react4xp.config.js
called `globals`. Whatever you had in `externals` should probably be moved to
`globals`.

React4xp builds a globals bundle, which MUST contain all assets NEEDED to render
server-side. By default it contains react and react-dom, but more assets can be
added.

By default the globals bundle is also used on the client-side, but you can
disable the serving of the globals bundle to the client-side in the Application
configuration and provide the REQUIRED assets on your own, for example via CDN.

It is possible to have pure client-side rendered components in React4xp.
If these components use assets which are NOT needed to render server-side you
should add them to `externals` and not `globals`. This way those assets will not
be bundled and must be provided by other means, for example via CDN.

=== Lazy loading (eager removed)

React4xp now supports pure clientSide rendered components. Such components may
include code that doesn't run on the server. Since eager loading would load all
components, it would cause errors on the server (sometimes severe). Lazy loading
only loads the components needed for the current serverSide rendering, not
wasting cpu cycles on loading code it may never run.

Since lazy loading is now the default, and there is no eager loading anymore we
have also removed the `react4xp.ssrLazyload` setting from the application
configuration file (app.cfg)

=== Application configuration

We have added three new application configurations (hydrate, serveGlobals and
ssr), and removed a few ones too (ssr.engineName, ssr.lazyLoad and
ssr.settings).

==== react4xp.hydrate

Add this to $XP_HOME/config/app.cfg:

```cfg
react4xp.hydrate = false
```

To disable client-side hydration for all React4xp components (page, layout, parts, etc)

You can still override the application configuration in specific controllers.

```someController.ts
    render(compnent, props, request, {
        // Default is to use application configuration
        // SSR without hydration will always be enforced when request.mode === 'edit'
        // hydrate: true // Hydration when ssr = true
        // hydrate: false // No hydration even when ssr = true
    })
```

==== react4xp.serveGlobals

To disable serving the globals bundle to the client-side add the line below to
${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg.

```${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg
	react4xp.serveGlobals = false
```

==== react4xp.ssr

Add this to $XP_HOME/config/app.cfg:

```cfg
react4xp.ssr = false
```

To disable server-side rendering for all parts (doesn't affect page and layouts)

You can still override the application configuration in specific part controllers.

```partController.ts
    render(compnent, props, request, {
        // Default is to use application configuration
        // SSR without hydration will always be enforced when request.mode === 'edit'
        // ssr: true // "Always" SSR
        // ssr: false // "Always" client-side rendering
    })
```

==== react4xp.ssr.lazyLoad

Lazyloading is now always enabled.

Therefore this setting has been removed. 

=== Multiple React4xp apps

You can now use components from multiple React4xp apps on the same webpage.
If the apps are importing any of the same assets, it could be a good idea to
load those assets from CDN so they aren't part of the vendor bundles.

It's also a good idea to set Application Configuration
`react4xp.serveGlobals = false` for both apps, and provide all globals
(including react and react-dom) on your own, rather than loading two copies of
the globals into the browser.

==== Client & Executor

To enable multiple React4xp applications on the same page global variables has
been prefixed with the application name. Obviously the application name is not
available when bulding lib-react4xp, so the building of the client and executor
has been moved from lib-react4xp to @enonic/react4xp.

=== Content Studio

SSR without hydration used to be enforced for both `edit` and `inline` mode in Content Studio.

Now React4xp will only enforce SSR without hydration in Content Studio `edit` mode. 

`inline` mode will use normal React4xp rendering, just as `preview` and `live` mode.

=== Gradle

We have simplified the gradle setup a lot.

All old references to React4xp in the build.gradle file, must be removed.


These files no longer exist:

* node_modules/@enonic/react4xp/react4xp.gradle
* node_modules/@enonic/react4xp/npmInstall.gradle
* node_modules/@enonic/react4xp/updaters.gradle

See more under the <<_build_gradle, build.gradle>> section below.

=== Enonic XP dev mode

When running Enonic XP in dev mode, it may be faster to build without using gradle at all.

See the required changes to the build.gradle and package.json files in the How section below.

=== System environment variables

When building with gradle, it will automatically set some system environment variables for you.

However if you want to build without using gradle you have to set them up on your own.

These two are required:

* R4X_APP_NAME (find the appName in gradle.properties)
* R4X_DIR_PATH_ABSOLUTE_PROJECT (cwd/pwd)

These two are optional:

* R4X_BUILD_LOG_LEVEL (use INFO to get some extra logging when building)
* NODE_ENV (the default is production, set it to development for no hashing, nor minification, etc...)

=== Component props (react4xpId)

React4xp used to add an extra prop called react4xpId, which was used during
clientSide hydration and rendering. This prop is no longer needed as it is
provided by other means (`script[data-react4xp-ref]`).

So now: React component props are just normal React component props :)

=== document polyfill

Several frameworks and node modules uses `document` to determine whether it's code
is running on the server, or in the browser. By polyfilling `document` that
logic is broken. So React4xp is no longer polyfilling `document`.

TIP: If your code is using `document`, and is not a pure client-side component:
you should wrap the code with an if block to avoid that code being run on the
server.

WARNING: If you are importing some "broken" module that uses `document` without
checking for client or server, you may polyfill `document` on your own, but it
might break other modules which now thinks the server is the client...

== How

=== build.gradle

```build.gradle
dependencies {
    include "com.enonic.lib:lib-react4xp:4.x.x"
}
```

Remove all the old react4xp* tasks from your build.gradle file.

If your project is based on an earlier version of the starter-react4xp also remove the reac4xp plugin

```build.gradle 
plugins {
  id 'react4xp' // Delete this line
}
```

You can probably also delete the entire buildSrc folder from your project.

Add this instead:

```build.gradle
task react4xp(type: NpmTask, dependsOn: npmInstall) {
  args = [
    'run',
    'build:react4xp' // This script must exist in the package.json file
  ]
  description 'Compile React4xp resources'
  environment = [
    'R4X_APP_NAME': "${appName}",
    'R4X_BUILD_LOG_LEVEL': gradle.startParameter.logLevel.toString(),
    'R4X_DIR_PATH_ABSOLUTE_PROJECT': project.projectDir.toString(),
    'NODE_ENV': project.hasProperty('dev') || project.hasProperty('development') ? 'development' : 'production'
  ]
  group 'react4xp'
  // It also watches package.json and package-lock.json :)
  inputs.dir 'node_modules/@enonic/react4xp'
  inputs.dir 'src/main/resources'
  outputs.dir 'build/resources/main'
}
jar.dependsOn 'react4xp'
```

=== package.json

When runnning Enonic XP in dev mode, it's possible to build without using gradle.

In order to build without gradle we had to move npm explore command from build.gradle to the package.json file:

```package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build:react4xp": "npm explore @enonic/react4xp -- npm run build:react4xp",
  }
}
```

Install or upgrade the React4xp build system:

`+npm install --save-dev @enonic/react4xp+`

`+npm upgrade @enonic/react4xp+`

or

`+yarn add --dev @enonic/react4xp+`

`+yarn upgrade @enonic/react4xp --latest+`


=== react4xp.config.js

```react4xp.config.js
	// Used in ssr component(s)
	globals: {
		lodash: '_'
	},
	// Used in pure clientSide component(s).
	// Must be provided by other means, for example CDN.
	externals: {
		jquery: 'jQuery'
	},
```

=== app.cfg

Hydration is enabled by default, to change the default to disabled add the line
below to ${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg. One can still enable hydration in
specific components.

```${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg
	react4xp.hydrate = false
```

SSR is enabled by default, to change the default to disabled add the line below
to ${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg. One can still enable ssr in specific
components.

```${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg
	react4xp.ssr = false
```

To disable serving the globals bundle to the client-side add the line below to
${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg.

```${XP_HOME}/config/${app}.cfg
	react4xp.serveGlobals = false
```

=== import/require in controllers


==== TypeScript named function

```examplePart.ts
import {render} from '/lib/enonic/react4xp';

export function get(request) {
    return render(component, props, request, {
      // Optional
      // hydrate: false,
      // ssr: false
    });
}
```

==== TypeScript class

```examplePart.ts
import {React4xp} from '/lib/enonic/react4xp';
```

==== Common.JS "named" function

```examplePart.js
const libReact4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function (request) {
    return libReact4xp.render(component, props, request, {
      // Optional
      // hydrate: false,
      // ssr: false
    });
}
```

==== Common.JS class

```examplePart.js
const libReact4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function (request) {
    const r4x = new libs.react4xp.React4xp(jsxPath);
    r4x.setId(id);
    r4x.setProps(props);
    return {
      body: r4x.renderBody({
        body: body,
        request: request,
        // ssr: ssr, // Optional
      }),
      pageContributions: r4x.renderPageContributions({
        // hydrate: hydrate, // Optional
        pageContributions: pageContributions,
        request: request,
        // ssr: ssr, // Optional
      })
    };
}
```

=== tsconfig*.json

==== TypeChecking for your code editor (tsconfig.json)

```tsconfig.json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "jsx": "react",
        "lib": [
            "DOM", // The server doesn't supports DOM, beeing permissive
            "ES2015",
        ],
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "target": "ES2015",
    },
    "include": [
        "./src/main/resources/**/*.ts",
        "./src/main/resources/**/*.tsx"
    ],
}
```

===== package.json

`+yarn add --dev @types/react+`

==== TypeChecking for React4xp code (tsconfig.react4xp.json)

```tsconfig.react4xp.json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "jsx": "react",
        "lib": [
            "DOM",
            "ES2015",
        ],
        "moduleResolution": "node",
        "skipLibCheck": true,
        "target": "ES2015",
    },
    "include": [
        "./src/main/resources/**/*.tsx"
    ],
}
```

===== package.json

`+yarn add --dev typescript+`

```package.json
  "scripts": {
    "verify:types:react4xp": "npx tsc --noEmit -p tsconfig.react4xp.json"
  }
```

=== React4xp components

You may want to convert your React components from EcmaScript to TypeScript.

`+git mv Component.jsx Component.tsx+`

On mac this should rename all jsx files under src/main/resources

`+for filePath in $(find src/main/resources -iname "*.jsx"); do git mv $filePath "$(echo $filePath | rev | cut -d '.' -f 2- | rev).tsx"; done+`

Start adding types for parameters, etc.
