. TODO

Right of the bat, start by adding a React component (tsx) file to your project:

TODO: Place elsewhere

./src/main/resources/react4xp/components/Person.tsx
[source,TSX]
----
TODO
----

<1> React component that will render "Hello React4XP!"
<2> The `export default` line is required, it _may_ take a props object and _must_ return a react component.

This component will be executed, and rendered server-side.



== Component registry

. TODO


=== Controller mapping

What a start, coming up, let's make the component come alive on the <<hydration#, client side>> as well.
