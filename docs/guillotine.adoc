= Going Headless, part 1: Guillotine and graphQL
:toc: right
:imagesdir: media/



== Some background

In the previous chapters we've looked at a "traditional CMS" way of using react4xp: as content directly presented (and augmented) by react components, served together by XP. This is fairly easy to set up and works fine for many use cases. But in other cases, we may not want such a tight connection between the content and the presentational components. There may be advantages of handling/serving them separately - or an approach where a content-exposing API works alongside a traditional CMS, as a supplement. These approaches are often called a link:https://enonic.com/blog/headless-or-decoupled-cms[headless] or link:https://enonic.com/blog/what-is-hybrid-cms[hybrid] CMS.

In Enonic XP, project link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/headless-cms/stable[guillotine] is a go-to solution for extending the existing CMS capabilities. It exposes a read-only link:https://graphql.org/[GraphQL] API, and provides the ability to *read pure content data* (the "body" in the analogy) from XP with great flexibility and high performance.

Combining this with react as the presentational component (the "head") opens up a range of ways to use XP in headless/hybrid manners. This makes guillotine a neat and natural companion to react4xp, so the *guillotine library is included in the react4xp starter* along with two extra helper wrappers.

We will now look at how to use react4xp with guillotine in different ways, for different levels of decoupling.



== Lesson overview

This chapter will focus on setting up the guillotine api and the first usages:

- making *a graphQL query* for content data in a regular XP controller,
- using react4xp to *visualize that data*,
- letting the rendered components make *the same query from the frontend*,
- and use react to dynamically render a visualization of the returned data, and this way fill in more content as we scroll down the page: an *"infinite scroller"* page.

TIP: The _next_ chapter will build on this lesson and demonstrate more decoupled (and less XP-centric) ways to use these same react4xp components in a *standalone webapp*, to render content data from a guillotine API.
