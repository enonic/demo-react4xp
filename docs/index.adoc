* Works with CMS Schemas in other apps as well as inline 
* Isomorphic server side and client side rendering through hydration
* Supports Enonic page templates and components
* Fast and continuous builds
* Optimized builds and static asset handling
* Flexible enough to cover many advanced use cases
