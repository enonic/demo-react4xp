**UPDATED {docdate}:** multiple adaptations for starter and lib version 1.0.0.

This documentation expects basic knowledge of React, XP and Webpack.

* https://developer.enonic.com/start[the Enonic XP developer portal].
* https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/[webpack documentation].

== Introduction

This tutorial will show you step-by-step how to build XP sites and apps with React rendering, helping you kickstart a React4xp project of your own.

During this exercise you will:

- set up the starter and meet the React4xp library,
- learn how to use it to render a basic React component from any regular XP controller,
- inject editorial data into your React component,
- see how to point the controller to the React components - and where to put them in your project source,
- dig a little deeper into ways of controlling the rendering,


== React4XP

image:react4xp.svg[title="React4xp logo",width=256px]

This starter is based on *React4XP*, which is a library (with a companion build structure) that facilitates use of React in Enonic XP, and:

* enables you to use JSX as a templating language, similar to other XP templating engines
* supports isomorphic client- or serverside rendering and hydration,
* handles build flow and compilation with automated optimized asset serving
* is modular and tweakable, making it possible to pop the hood, pick it apart and set things up your own way. Godspeed!
* is flexible enough to cover many advanced use cases,


== Setup

=== Create project

Set up the starter project locally. With Enonic XP 7, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
enonic project create -r starter-react4xp
----

Remember to create a *new XP sandbox* when completing the project wizard.

[TIP]
====
*Don't have the Enonic CLI?* Visit the https://developer.enonic.com/start[Getting started guide] to install it.

*Only want to inject react4xp into your own XP project?* The https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/master/README.md[lib-react4xp docs] have a section on how to do without the starter. But it's recommended to go through this introduction first.
====

=== Project structure

If you're used to working with a typical XP project using https://developer.enonic.com/templates/webpack[webpack], the structure in your project root folder will now look familiar -
the biggest news is `react4xp.properties` and the folder `resources/react4xp/`.

TIP: This is just an overview, no need to know it by heart to get started - we'll get back to all of these in more detail. For the most impatient, the takeaway is: *put your JSX source files somewhere below `react4xp/entries/` or `site/`*.

[source,files]
----
build.gradle                <--1-->
gradle.properties
settings.gradle
package.json

react4xp.properties         <--2-->

src/
  main/
    resources/
      react4xp/             <!--3-->
        entries/
        shared/

----

<1> A set of gradle config files and `package.json`. These define the build process and project structure, and in particular, make sure that the *lib-react4xp library* and *react4xp npm package* are installed right.
<2> `react4xp.properties`: tune the most common properties of the react4xp project.
<3> The `react4xp/` folder is opt-in: can be ignored for now, and doesn't need to contain anything. But when fine-tuning the build later in the tutorial, we'll get back to why you might find it handy to have a separate place for some of your react components (in ultra-short: the `entries\` folder is for react components that can be used directly by react4xp, the `shared\` folder is for common components imported by, and shared between, the entries).


{zwsp} +

=== Build and Deploy

To build and deploy the starter app, run this command from your shell:

[source, bash]
----
enonic project deploy
----

Accept starting the sandbox.

[NOTE]
====
To verify that your app started successfully, you should find an entry similar to this in the sandbox log:

`2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [<name.of.your.app>] installed successfully`

[[hello_react_page]]
== 1: Hello React: server and clientside

React4xp is made to cover many ways of combining XP and react. Let's start with a simple scenario: just displaying a working react component in content studio. We'll first do that in the serverside rendered way (this is the react4xp default). And afterwards add an option flag that turns the rendering into clientside-rendering instead.

We'll do this by adding a regular XP page controller we'll call _hello-react_:

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/pages/hello-react/
  hello-react.xml
  hello-react.jsx
  hello-react.es6
----

These files are not included in the starter - use your copy/paste skills and remember that `hello-react` must be identical between file names and folder name.

{zwsp} +

=== Code

First, we need a *page definition* XML file. Just XP boilerplate:

.hello-react.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<page>
  <display-name>Hello React</display-name>
  <description>Super simple example</description>
  <form />
</page>
----

Next, we'll add the *react component*. This displays a "Hello world" heading, and we'll add some simple functionality to it: every time you click the message, it will update a number in the next line and print a message in the console. This is to show that we're rendering an _active_ react component; we're not only using JSX as an XP templating language for static HTML - although sure, you could do that too if you want.

Obviously, the actual updating step is done with vanilla JS instead of actual react, just to keep everything as simple as possible. We'll look at stateful/dynamic components later.

.hello-react.jsx
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

let bottleCount = 99;
function dropBottle() {
    bottleCount--;
    console.log(bottleCount, 'bottles of beer on the wall.');
    document.getElementById('counter').innerText = bottleCount;
};

export default (props) => <div onClick={dropBottle}>
    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Click me: <span id="counter">{bottleCount}</span> bottles of beer on the wall.</p>
</div>;
----

[NOTE]
====
One thing is mandatory for this to work, shown in the last line: the JSX file *must default-export a function* that *_may_ take a props object* and *_must_ return a react component*. More on this link:#entries[later].

Apart from that, you can use ordinary ES6 and import and nest other JS, react components and third-party stuff from node_modules in the regular way (there is a caveat or two here. We'll get back to that too later).
====
Finally, we'll add a bare-bone *page controller* that calls the rendering engine:

[[first_helloreact_jsx]]
.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');       // <1>

exports.get = function(request) {                       // <2>
    const entry = portal.getComponent();                // <3>
    const props = null;

    return React4xp.render(                             // <4>
        entry,
        props,
        request,
        {
            id: "react4xpApp",                          // <5>
            body:                                       // <6>
                `
                    <html>
                        <head></head>
                        <body class="xp-page">
                            <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                        </body>
                    </html>
                `
        }
    )
};
----




That's it.

If you've used XP before, you'll probably note that there's no HTML view file, no `thymeleaf.render`, and so on - in this example, react4xp completely handles the page view. The essential thing here is that at the end of the `get` function, *react4xp in a single _.render_ call creates a _full_ XP response object that makes react work.*

What's going on in the controller?

<1> In line 2, `React4xp` is imported from the library.
<2> In line 4, we pick up the `request` data. The render call needs it to know the rendering context.
<3> In line 5, we get the XP component data. Used directly in the `.render` call, it's a convenient shortcut for react4xp to "this XP component", for finding the same-name react component in the same folder: _hello-react.jsx_. React4xp has more ways to refer to react components, or _entries_ (we'll get to that under link:#_react4xp_render[the render call] and link:#jsxPath[jsx paths]).
<4> In line 8, the juicy bit: *the actual render call*. The rendered response from it can be returned directly from the `get` function, since `.render` creates an object with a `body` HTML string and a `pageContributions` attribute with everything needed (more about this link:#_react4xp_render[below]).
<5> In line 13, the `id` attribute _"react4xpApp"_ is set in the *options* argument of `.render` (lines 12-20). This is the unique ID we're giving to the react component, and the HTML id of the target element where react will render the component in the end. Note that the same ID is found in an element in the HTML `body`:
<6> In lines 14-19, we're hardcoding a `body` option, an HTML string as a base for the output, with a _"react4xpApp"_ ID element. In many cases you can do without this string but here it's needed for the output, since react itself doesn't like to render the tags `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` or anything outside of a containing root tag (such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`).

{zwsp} +

[[first_setup_render]]
=== Setup and first render

If you've added those 3 files, let's get this rendered! If you've used XP and Content Studio before, this is all run-of-the mill:

1. Compile the project (`enonic project deploy` in a terminal from root) and start the sandbox (`enonic sandbox start`),
2. Navigate your browser to `localhost:8080/admin`. Log in to XP and open Content Studio (if you haven't already, you'll need to link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/content-studio[install Content Studio] in XP).
3. Create a new Site content and Edit it in a new tab. Add your react4xp app (_"starter-react4xp"_?) on the upper left.
4. Select the new _Hello-react_ page controller in the preview panel on the right. Store that change (and refresh the page if needed).

You should now see something like this:

[.thumb]
image:hello_cs.png[link="media/hello_cs.png",title="Editing in Content Studio: Hello World. Click to see a high-res version", width=600px]

{zwsp} +

[start=5]
5. Click _Preview_ on the top to open a new tab and view the content outside of Content Studio:

[.thumb]
image:hello_bottles.png[link="media/hello_bottles.png",title="Rendering: Hello World and some bottles on a wall somewhere. Bet you clicked this screenshot, didn't you?", width=600px]

{zwsp} +

Clicking somewhere on the rendered text in the preview window will trigger the `dropBottle` function from _hello-react.jsx_, and modify the DOM and output a message in the browser console. Look at those bottles go!

{zwsp} +

[[static_cs_rendering]]
==== Two notes on the rendering before we move on:
====
*STATIC RENDERING IN CONTENT STUDIO*

If you clicked the rendering _inside XP Content Studio_ instead of a preview tab, you'd notice there was *no bottle-counting*. This is on purpose: react functionality may intervene with the Content Studio editorial workflow, or even disrupt Content Studio itself. Therefore, the `request` argument is used in `React4xp.render` to handle this automatically: inside Content Studio, you'll only see the rendering as a regular static XP preview / placeholder instead of active react.

NOTE: Later, we'll look at two other rendering functions: `.renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions`. These are intended for use cases where it's good to be more explicit than `React4xp.render`. For that reason, they _don't automatically handle this for you_. Usually, you should still keep your components from being client-activated inside Content Studio, but you'll have to handle it yourself. link:#custom_flow[Example 4 shows you how].
====

{zwsp} +

====
*SLOW FIRST SERVERSIDE RENDERING*

You may also have noticed that it took a few seconds for the very first rendering to be displayed, either here or in the edit/browse mode in Content Studio. That's the *Nashorn server-side rendering engine warming up*. It reads and caches the basics (notably, some necessary polyfilling, react and react-dom) for performance.

We're looking into mitigating this delay in the future, but for now, this is nice to know: *This delay only happens when your app is restarted*, i.e. you restart XP entirely, or redeploy the app. Setting up a continuous build with XP devmode instead, helps. For the react4xp starter, here's how:

`enonic sandbox start <yourSandBoxName> --dev` in one terminal (from anywhere), and

`enonic project deploy && gradlew react4xp_components compileXP -t` from project root in another terminal. Reply _No_ if it asks you to start the sandbox here.
====

{zwsp} +

[[hello_output]]
=== Output

Okay, back to the rendering of the page. Open the *page source* code in the browser. Here's what `React4xp.render` created - the response the client receives on the initial page request:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body class="xp-page">

    <div id="react4xpApp">
        <div data-reactroot="">                     <!--1-->
            <h1>Hello world!</h1>
            <p>Click me: <span id="counter">99</span> bottles of beer on the wall. </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/externals.489d97cdf.js"></script>      <!--2-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp-client/"></script>                     <!--3-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/site/pages/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script>  <!--4-->
    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate(                                                        <!--5-->
            React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react'],
            "react4xpApp",
            null,
            1, 0);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
----
We can see this whole output is actually the `body` HTML string we passed into the `React4xp.render` call in the controller - but *a lot has been inserted*. Most importantly, three assets are loaded into the client.

(The asset URLs are shortened for readability, and because some details may vary. At my computer for example, the `(...your.app.service)` part actually looks like: `/admin/site/preview/default/draft/hello-react/_/service/com.enonic.app.react4xp/`)

<1> At the top, we see the `<div id="react4xpApp">` target container, now filled with a server-side rendering of the react component. At this point it's only static markup, but it will be activated during step 5 below.
<2> The first asset is `externals.<contenthash>.js`: this is react and react-dom bundled together. They are served from XP instead of from a CDN. If you want to read more about why, or how to tweak the externals, see the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-externals[externals docs on NPM].
<3> The second loaded asset is a client-wrapper, available in the browser's namespace as `React4xp.CLIENT`. For more, see the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client[client wrapper docs on NPM].
<4> The third asset is the compiled version of _hello-react.jsx_, with the react component and the `dropBottle` routine. During `React4xp.render`, react4xp used the `component` data to locate this asset _after_ compiling. The react component gets an identifier string, `site/pages/hello-react/hello-react`, which is called a _jsxPath_ in react4xp. We'll link:#jsxPath[cover jsxPaths in more detail later], but for now you just need to know that this identifier is also used when loading this asset into the the browser's namespace: `React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react']`.
<5> Finally, the trigger. The CLIENT wrapper calls link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client#hydrate[hydrate] to activate react in the serverside-rendered asset `React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react']` in the target container `"react4xpApp"`. Now the `dropBottle` function works! We haven't added any props yet, hence the `null` argument. The final two digits `1, 0` are internal react4xp housekeeping, flagging some possible need for client-side postprocessing.

NOTE: The assets are served by lib-react4xp services. Most of them (_react4xp-client_ and the content-hashed assets) are optimized for client-side caching, to minimize repeated requests.

{zwsp} +

=== Client-side rendering

Sometimes you might want or need to skip the server-side rendering of a react component, and relay the react rendering entirely to the browser. This a one-line operation in `React4xp.render`. Let's return to *the controller*:


.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const entry = portal.getComponent();
    const props = null;

    return React4xp.render(
        entry,
        props,
        request,
        {
            id: "react4xpApp",
            body:
                `
                    <html>
                        <head></head>
                        <body class="xp-page">
                            <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                        </body>
                    </html>
                `,
            clientRender: true                          // <1>
        }
    )
};
----
<1> On the server, a truthy `clientRender` flag in the _options_ object makes the server skip the HTML rendering (in _this_ particular `.render` call. Mixing up clientside and serverside rendering across different places hasn't been tested very much, but it should work fine).

If you compare with link:#hello_output[the serverside-rendered example], the `clientRender` flag causes the *rendered output* to change slightly, changing the behavior in the browser.

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body class="xp-page">

    <div id="react4xpApp"></div>    <!--1-->

    <!--2-->
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/externals.489d97cdf.js"></script>
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp-client/"></script>
    <script src="(...your.app.service) /react4xp/site/pages/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script>

    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.render(     <!--3-->
            React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react'],
            "react4xpApp",
            null,
            1, 0);
    </script>
</body>
</html>
----
<1> As expected, the target container is no longer filled with a serverside-rendered HTML representation of the react component. Instead, the browser fills in the DOM from scratch in step 3 below.
<2> The compiled assets and their URLs are exactly the same as in the serverside version.
<3> The trigger is changed: the `React4xp.CLIENT` wrapper calls link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-runtime-client#render[render] and makes the browser build the DOM inside the target element from scratch (instead of calling `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate`, which activates/replaces existing HTML). The function signatures of `React4xp.CLIENT.render` and `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate` are identical.

NOTE: As link:#static_cs_rendering[mentioned before], this only applies _outside_ of Content Studio. The `clientRender` flag does not change anything inside Content Studio: still server-side rendered static HTML.

Apart from these differences behind the scenes, the page will look and behave the same when presented to the user.

Finally, it's worth mentioning a special case where you might want to _temporarily_ clientside-render a component:

[TIP]
====
You might get _serverside runtime errors_ in the react components that you write. The Nashorn rendering engine will dump an error message and some suspected code in the server log - but it's not always easy to make sense of those.

Often, switching over to _clientside rendering_ for that particular react component, will give you a better/sourcemapped error message in the browser console, making your debugging life easier.
====

Okay, ready for the next example lesson?

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[editorial_props]]
== 2: Editorial data and props

Here we'll spice up our react component a little bit by using `props` to insert editorial data from XP into the react component.

We'll modify the same files you created above:

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/pages/hello-react/
  hello-react.xml
  hello-react.jsx
  hello-react.es6
----

{zwsp} +

=== Code

Now let's change the files some more so we can use Content Studio to input some data into the react rendering.

We start with some standard XP procedure: defining the data in the *page definition* XML file. This file is the same as in example 1, but we're adding a few link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/input-types[input fields] under `<form>`. `greeting`, `greetee`, `counted` and `startCount` are the basis for the initial props of the react component:

.hello-react.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<page>
  <display-name>Hello React</display-name>
  <description>Editorial example</description>
    <form>
        <input type="TextLine" name="greeting">
            <label>What's the greeting?</label>
            <default>Hello</default>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
        </input>

        <input type="TextLine" name="greetee">
            <label>Who shall we greet?</label>
            <default>world</default>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
        </input>

        <input type="TextLine" name="counted">
            <label>What are the things on the wall?</label>
            <default>bottles of beer</default>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
        </input>

        <input type="Long" name="startCount">
            <label>How many of them are there?</label>
            <default>99</default>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
        </input>
    </form>
</page>
----

Next, we'll modify the *react component* so that it displays data from a `props` object, instead of hardcoding everything.

[[hello_react_jsx_modified]]
.hello-react.jsx
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';


function makeThingDropper(droppableProp, initialCountProp) {
    let currentCount = initialCountProp;
    return () => {
        currentCount--;
        console.log(currentCount.toString(), droppableProp, 'on the wall.');
        document.getElementById('counter').innerText = currentCount;
    };
}

export default (props) => {
    const dropThing = makeThingDropper(props.droppableThing, props.initialCount);
    return (
        <div onClick={dropThing}>
            <h1>
                {props.message} {props.messageTarget}!
            </h1>
            <p>
                Click me: <span id="counter">{props.initialCount}</span> {props.droppableThing} on the wall.
            </p>
        </div>
    );
}
----

[TIP]
====
`props` are of course the standard react way to do this. It all is. As long as a _props => reactComponent_ function is default-exported, react4xp accepts standard valid ES6/JSX.

Although, if you think that the _makeObjectDropper_ closure thing is a strange way to do something react itself could do better... I can't argue with that. Just trying to stay focused on one thing at a time.
====

And lastly, we'll hook them together: modify *the controller* to fetch the data we defined in XML, then use a `props` object to inject the data into the react component:

[[controller_with_props]]
.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');


exports.get = function(request) {
    const entry = portal.getComponent();

    const content = portal.getContent();                    // <1>
    const pageConfig = (content.page || {}).config || {};

    const props = {                                         // <2>
        message: pageConfig.greeting,                       // <3>
        messageTarget: pageConfig.greetee,
        droppableThing: pageConfig.things,
        initialCount: pageConfig.startCount
    };

    return React4xp.render(
        entry,
        props,                                              // <4>

                    <head></head>
                    <body class="xp-page">
                        <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                    </body>
                </html>
            `

    )
};

----

<1> Fetching the content data defined in the XML (and in the next line, we're unpacking it into `pageConfig` while choosing that missing data should just display emptiness, not throw an error).
<2> The `props` object is just any standard JS object. So the data can of course come from anywhere you want and take any shape - with one exception: `props` needs to be *serializable*, so functions can't be passed here!
<3> Connecting the field names in `pageConfig` from _hello-react.xml_ to the prop names that _hello-react.jsx_ needs.
<4> See how this makes the first two arguments of `React4xp.render` analogous to XP's `thymeleaf.render` template engine? The first argument, `entry`, is just a reference to what should be rendered (_react component_ ~ _template_), and the second one is a collection of data injected into it (_props_ ~ _model_).
<5> To keep things simpler and clearer, just remove the `clientRender` flag from the previous example.

There it is, now let's take a look!

{zwsp} +

=== Setup and rendering

Compile the project, enter Content Studio Repeat (the first two steps in link:#first_setup_render[the previous setup]), and edit the content you created (double-click it to open a new tab).

You should still see it in the preview panel on the right (although, since you probably created the content without any data created along with it, it might not display much of the text. We'll fix that):

[.thumb]
image:hello_cs.png[link="media/hello_cs.png"title="Editing Hello World, same as before. Click to see a high-res version", width=600px]

{zwsp} +

Now, when you click the preview panel, the page-config editing panel should open on the right, with the data fields containing the default text we defined. Once you click Apply/save, the preview panel to the left should update.

[.thumb]
image:hello_editorial.png[link="media/hello_editorial.png",title="Editing Hello World in the page-config panel in Content Studio. Click to see a high-res version!", width=600px]

{zwsp} +

So now, it looks the same as before, but with editorial data instead of hardcoded text. Boring, and too similar to the previous example; just repeating "Hello World" might cause a little confusion. *Try adding your own data in the fields*, for example changing _"world"_ into _"link:https://montypython.fandom.com/wiki/Bruces_sketch[Bruce]"_ etc, to keep it clear.

*Apply/save* your new props, and the output should change again. But since we're still in Content Studio, it's justa static serverside-rendered update. To see the final rendering with your new data, all active, click _Preview_ on the top to open the page in a fresh tab:

[.thumb]
image:gday_bruce.png[link="media/gday_bruce.png",title="Rendering: G'day Bruce. This is turning into one big philosophers' joke, isn't it?", width=600px]

{zwsp} +

=== Output

So did anything change in the rendered response, compared to link:#hello_output[the first serverside-rendered example]? Not all that much, actually. Depending on what data you inserted and the resulting `props`, your page source should look something like this:

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<html>
<head></head>
<body class="xp-page">

    <!--1-->
    <div id="react4xpApp">
        <div data-reactroot="">
            <h1>G'day<!-- --> <!-- -->Bruce<!-- --> !</h1>
            <p>Click me: <span id="counter">42</span> <!-- -->tubes<!-- --> on the wall.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--2-->
    <script src="/admin/site/preview/default/draft/hello-react/_/service/com.enonic.app.react4xp/react4xp/externals.489d97cdf.js"></script>
    <script src="/admin/site/preview/default/draft/hello-react/_/service/com.enonic.app.react4xp/react4xp-client/"></script>
    <script src="/admin/site/preview/default/draft/hello-react/_/service/com.enonic.app.react4xp/react4xp/site/pages/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script>

    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate(
            React4xp['site/pages/hello-react/hello-react'],
            "react4xpApp",
            {                           <!--3-->
                "message": "G'day",
                "messageTarget": "Bruce",
                "droppableThing": "tubes",
                "initialCount": 42,
                "react4xpId": "react4xpApp"
            },
            1, 0
        );
    </script>
</body>
</html>

----
<1> Since we removed the `clientRender` flag again, the target container `react4xpApp` comes filled from the server. But now with a rendering with _your_ texts from `props` already inserted.
<2> There's still no change in the asset URLs, but since we changed _hello-react.jsx_, the content of _hello-react.js_ has of course been recompiled.
<4> The `props` are used in the clientside `.hydrate` call. For convenience, the `id` is automatically added as the `react4xpId` prop. Handy for use cases where a react component needs to uniquely identify itself.


{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[_react4xp_render]]
== React4xp.render

Now might be a good time to take a closer look at the `.render` call from the ES6 controller in link:#controller_with_props[the example above]:

====
React4xp's `.render` is a one-in-all shorthand function for a lot of use cases. Basically, take any HTML string and pass it through `.render` as a `body` option, and react4xp will insert the react component into the HTML string and add any necessary page contributions to make it all work.

{zwsp} +

*Signature*, analogous to thymeleaf's familiar `render(view, model`) signature - but with some extra parameters and a full XP response object returned:

`{body, pageContributions} = React4xp.render(entry, props, request, options);`

{zwsp} +

*Parameters:*

- `entry` (mandatory, string or component object): this is the reference to the "template", the react component to be rendered. If it's a JSX file with the same name in the same folder as an XP component, simply use the `portal.getComponent()` object here. In this example,  it's the _hello-react_ page, but you can do the same thing from part or layout controllers too. We'll come back to a more specific way to reference files anywhere in your project, under link:#jsxPath[jsx path]. By the way, a react component that is used by react4xp this way is called link:#entries[an entry].
- `props` (optional object, must be serializable): data model passed into the react component.
- `request` (link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP request object], kind of optional, but _mandatory for react activation_): This is to keep the component rendered static and serverside-render if the rendering happens inside XP content studio. No browser react activation (or client-side rendering) happens inside content studio, you only get a visualization from the initial `props`. Special case: if `request` is omitted/falsy, page-contributions rendering is completely skipped. Note: the .render `options` argument is still valid: the rendered static HTML is still inserted into the HTML from the added `body`, and `pageContributions` are still added.
- `options` (optional object): additional options to control the rendering:

** `id` (string): ID of the component, matching the ID of an element in `body`. React will render into that container element, replacing whatever was already there. If missing, a random ID is generated.
** `body` (string): HTML string, a base for the returned `body`. Can be a hardcoded string, or come from a thymeleaf/mustache/XSLT render, and so on. Just make sure the `id` option matches an HTML id here (what happens if not? React4xp creates a target element with that ID, last in the root element of `body`). If there's no `body` option, a matching-ID `<div>` target container is generated.

** `pageContributions` (object): you might already have some page contributions you want to return together with the ones generated by react4xp. Same way as with `body`, just add them here to pass them through `render`. Order: the ones you add here are output before the ones rendered.
** `clientRender` (boolean): if `true` (truthy, actually), the server-side rendering is skipped (in live mode and previews. Inside content studio's browser or edit modes, you still only get a static server-side rendered representation).

{zwsp} +

*Returns* an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP response object] with these main attributes:

- `body`: rendered HTML string. When server-side rendered, the whole HTML is inserted into the matching-id element inside the `body` option (if the `body` option is added. If not, a surrounding `<div>` is used). When client-side rendered, no HTML is inserted into `body` (or the generated container) - that's left to the client.
- `pageContributions`: a regular link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions] object. Includes everything the browser needs to activate (or client-side render) the react component: auto-compiled assets for the entry (_hello-react.js_ in this example) and whatever it may depend on (most importantly, react and react-dom in an _externals_ asset), and a client-side react4xp wrapper asset. These are all optimized and served to the client by react4xp services.
====

`.render` is just one way. React4xp has other, more detailed and flexible ways of rendering, we'll link:#custom_flow[look at those] in a bit.

[[xp_pages_parts]]
== 3: XP Pages/Parts/Regions and Content

So far, we've used a "raw" XP Page and just rendered the react component directly from the controller there. It's fine in itself, but not really making good use of XP's excellent CMS powers. So let's move into that territory!

[TIP]
====
*TL;DR*: Naturally, this example will focus quite a bit on XP Content Studio and how to use Parts, Pages, Regions and Templates. If this is familiar to you, you can pretty much just skim through it - the key takeaways are:

  - `React4xp.render` works the same way from any controller.
  - React4xp comes with an importable `<Regions>` react component for making XP Regions
  - Each time the client calls `React.CLIENT.render` or `.hydrate` will create an independent react root app.
====

React4xp can also render from XP _Part or Layout controllers_, creating react-rendered XP elements that can be dragged into any regular XP Region. And besides, react4xp can (serverside) render these XP Regions themselves, which can then accept any XP Parts/Layouts dropped into them (as well as Fragments, Text and Image components of course).

In this example, we'll do both:

* Make a react-rendered general link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/components[XP Page Controller] with a working XP Region.
* Make a react-rendered link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/components#part[XP Part] that can be dragged into the Region.
* In addition, we'll display it in the "regular XP way": using a link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms#page_templates[Page Template] to connect a link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/content-types[Content Type] to our new Page controller. This way, in this example and the next ones, we can just create content items of that type and have the Page controller up and running immediately instead of having to set it up manually each time.

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/content-types/
  my-content/
    my-content.xml

site/pages/
  default/
    default.xml
    default.es6
    default.jsx

site/parts/
  color/
    color.xml
    color.es6
    color.jsx
----

[NOTE]
====
The Page controller _default_ can be made from scratch, or you can copy _site/pages/hello-react_ and change the copy (don't delete _hello-react.jsx_ just yet, we're going to re-use it link:#custom_flow[later]). If you copy and modify, just remember this as usual: name the the *folder and file names* identically.
====

{zwsp} +

=== Template with React Page Controller

==== Code: XP Content Type

We'll start with a completely generic content type: _site/content-types/my-content/my-content.xml_. Content types tend to define more than this, but for now, this is all we need:

.my-content.xml:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<content-type xmlns="urn:enonic:xp:model:1.0">
    <display-name>My Content</display-name>
    <description>Just some content</description>
    <super-type>base:structured</super-type>
    <form/>
</content-type>
----

Again, this has nothing to do with react4xp, but it'll make the setup of this and the next examples easier.

==== Code: XP Page controller

Now we'll make the react-based Page controller: _site/pages/default/_ will be a bare-bone page with nothing but a Region in it.

*The page definition* is simple. We're now leaving the `<form>` node empty, but adding a `<regions>` node with a single `"main"` Region defined in it:

.default.xml:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<page>
    <display-name>Default page</display-name>
    <description>React4xp-rendered Page controller</description>
    <form/>
    <regions>
        <region name="main"/>
    </regions>
</page>
----


*The react component* has a single focus, namely rendering the Region:

.default.jsx
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';
import Regions from 'react4xp-regions/Regions';    // <1>

export default (props) => (
    <div className="default-page">
        <Regions {...props} />                     // <2>
    </div>
);
----

<1> Importing a Region template from an NPM package that comes with react4xp (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp-regions[react4xp-regions]).
<2> Nesting the Region in our component. To be precise: it uses `props.regionsData` and selects the Region name(s) in `props.names`, so it will render _all_ Regions given by `props` if more than one is defined and selected.

The `props` of course come from the *Page controller*. Still similar to the previous examples, we're mainly just adding props that are needed by `<Regions>` in the react component.

.default.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----

const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const content = portal.getContent();
    const entry = portal.getComponent();

    const id = `react4xp_${content._id}`;   // <1>

    const props = {
        regionsData: content.page.regions,  // <2>
        names: "main",                      // <3>
        tag: "main",                        // <4>
    };

    return React4xp.render(
        entry,
        props,
        null,                               // <5>
        {
            id,
            body: `
                <html>
                    <head>
                        <title>${content.displayName}</title>
                    </head>
                    <body class="xp-page">
                        <div id="${id}"></div>
                    </body>
                </html>
            `
        }
    );
};
----

<1> The XP content ID is nice and unique, let's just use that to bind the react component to the target element in the DOM.
<2> Here, `content.page.regions` are content data containing the Region we defined in _default.xml_ as well as data about content dropped into it. This is mapped to the `regionsData` prop.
<3> The `names` prop can be a string or a string array. It's used to select which Regions (by Region name defined in _default.xml_) to render, in case there are more Regions in `content.page.regions`. Rendering will occur in the order of the string array. If the `names` prop is missing, all the regions defined in _default.jsx_ are rendered (so we could technically skip this prop here), but the order is less predictable if there's more than one Region.
<4> The optional `tag` prop sets which HTML tag will be at the root of the section rendered by `<Regions>`, instead of `<div>`. Here, we're going for `<main>`.
<5> We're setting the `request` argument of `React4xp.render` to _null_ - switching off the auto-handling of how _this_ particular rendering is done inside/outside Content Studio, and just forcing `React4xp.render` to *always output a static, serverside rendered HTML body without page contributions*. But why? Two reasons:
  - The way it is now, _default.jsx_ and the Regions in it has no need for page contributions. Only the static HTML is of interest; no client-side JS code needs to be activated/rendered in the client, and there's no styling or anything else coming from it. So by skipping the page contributions rendering, performance is improved a little.
  - There is a *caveat when using react4xp to render Regions* (like in _default.jsx_): currently, page contributions don't work for XP Parts/Layouts if they are dropped into a _clientside_-rendered Region. So Regions must be serverside rendered if they are meant to contain XP components that will need their own page contributions to work - for example react4xp parts, which rely on page contributions to be activated in the client). So by forcing a static serverside Regions rendering, we prevent that corner case from failing, and make sure _any_ XP element dropped inside the Region will work, even clientside-rendered react4xp parts.

TIP: Adding an XP Region to a Layout is the same, only easier: since it will be injected inside a Page, you don't need to add an outer `body` in the _options_ parameter, and therefore you don't need an `id` parameter either - same as in the XP Part controller below.

[[page_template_setup]]
==== Setting up the Template

Before we move on to the XP Part, let's bind this Page controller to the _my-content_ Content Type we just made, in the regular XP way. This lays the foundation for this example and also the later ones. When this is done, *using the _default_ Page controller will be easy*: create a new _my-content_ item in your site, and it will come out ready to use with the Region from _default_.

1. When you've deployed the updated app and logged into Content Studio, make a new Site content and connect it to the react4xp app (or re-use one of your previous ones).
2. In the grid (Content Studio browse mode), under your Site, create a new Template content under Templates:

[.thumb]
image:template_new.png[link="media/template_new.png",title="Creating a new Template content in Content Studio.", width=500px]

{zwsp} +

[start=3]
3. When editing your new Template, give it a display name, select your new content type _my-content_ in the _"Supports"_ drop-down menu on the left, and select the new Page controller _Default_ under the _"Template_" (or _"Page controller"_) drop-down menu on the right:

[.thumb]
image:template_edit.png[title="Using a Template to connect a content type to a page controller in Content Studio.", width=1024px]

{zwsp} +

[start=4]
4. Apply/save and you're done.

{zwsp} +

=== XP Part

Now we're ready to add a simple react-rendered Part to drop into the Region: _site/parts/color/_ .

==== Code

The *Part definition* pretty unremarkable now as well. There's just a `color` TextLine input field in the form:

.color.xml:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<part>
    <display-name>Color part</display-name>
    <description>React4xp rendered part with editorial color</description>
    <form>
        <input name="color" type="TextLine">
            <label>What's the color of the thing?</label>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
            <default>red</default>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----

*The react component* only displays the color name from the props and inline-styles it with that color (as long as the `props.color` value is HTML-compliant):

[[color_jsx]]
.color.jsx
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

export default (props) => (
    <div style={{
        border: `1px solid ${props.color}`,
        margin: "8px",
        padding: "8px",
        borderRadius: "10px"
    }}>
        <p style={{color: props.color}}>Hey, I'm pretty {props.color}!</p>
    </div>
);
----

Like before, *the controller* mainly hooks the XP editorial data into the props:

[[color_part_controller]]
.color.es6:
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {

    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const props = { color: component.config.color };

    return React4xp.render(
        component,
        props,
        request,
        {                               // <1>
            clientRender: true,         // <2>
            pageContributions: {        // <3>
                bodyEnd: `<script>console.log("The color of the thing is: ${component.config.color}");</script>`
            }
        });
};
----

<1> In the _options_ argument (the object with `clientRender` and `pageContributions`), notice how we're _not_ adding `body` or `id` like we did before. `body` is only needed for the controller to _add_ HTML around the rendered react - if you skip it a target container `<div>` will just be generated for you. With an autogenerated container, the ID will match either way: you can still set the ID value with the `id` _option_, or skip it and just let react4xp supply a unique ID. For details, see the link:#_react4xp_render[React4xp.render] box. For that matter, *we don't even need the options argument here at all* - it could be completely skipped...
<2> ...but for demonstrating, let's use it to show that this Part is _independent_ (from both the _default_ Page we defined a moment ago, and from any other Parts dropped into the same Region, react or otherwise), by clientside rendering the Part...
<3> ...and adding a tiny color-logging script with the Part. This is done by using the _options_ parameter to pass `pageContributions` through `.render`, the same way we've passed `body` through it so far.

[[adding_parts_to_new_content]]
=== Setup and render

Time to get this displayed and see it all in action! Again, just XP routine: creating a _my-content_ item, and since the Template makes it show up ready with a _default_ Page controller and Region, we can just drop our new _color_ Part into it.

1. As before, recompile/deploy and enter Content Studio. In the same Site as the Template you just made (but not under _Templates_), create a new _my-content_ item:

[.thumb]
image:content_new.png[link="media/content_new.png",title="Creating a new content item in Content Studio (click for high-res version)", width=500px]

[.thumb]
image:content_my.png[link="media/content_my.png",title="Selecting the new my-content type in Content Studio (click for high-res version)", width=500px]

{zwsp} +

[start=2]
2. When you edit the new content, the preview panel with a dash-bordered *_"Drop here"_ area* should appear on the right. This is the _default_ Page controller rendering the initially empty *Region*. To the far right, there should be a config panel with the _"Insert"_ tab (if you can't see them, use the screen and cogwheel icons on the top right):

[.thumb]
image:page_with_ready_region.png[link="media/page_with_ready_region.png",title="Editing new content in Content Studio, with Region ready to receive parts etc (click for high-res version)", width=500px]

{zwsp} +

[start=3]
3. Drag _"Part"_ from the config panel into the Region. In the dropdown menu (_"Type to search..."_) that appears in the Region (or the _"Part"_ dropdown menu now on the right), select your new _color_ Part. It should now appear correctly rendered in the preview panel (occasionally, you might need to _Save_ and refresh the page). And the config panel for editing the settings of that particular part should appear on the far right (if it doesn't, click the part itself: _"Hey, I'm pretty red"_):

[.thumb]
image:content_with_red_part.png[link="media/content_with_red_part.png",title="Editing new content in Content Studio, with Region ready to receive parts etc (click for high-res version)", width=500px]

{zwsp} +

4. Try experimenting with dragging other XP components from the _"Insert"_ tab into the Region. Say, a Text component, and/or adding another instance of the same _color_ Part but with a different (HTML-compliant) color value in the Part config panel. You'll see that the react-rendered Region accepts all regular XP components, and that multiple instances of the same _color_ Part remain independent from each other.
5. As usual, clicking _Preview_ on the top will open a new Preview tab for your page.

=== Output
We won't go into the details about the HTML output anymore - it's structurally and conceptually *the same as in the previous examples*. Looking at the _Page Source_, it should all make sense to you by now: the Page controller and Part are *compiled to separate assets and downloaded exactly once* in the client before calling `React4xp.CLIENT.render` and `.hydrate` as needed (using a react4xp Part more than once does not make the client download the assets more than once - they're recycled for performance).

NOTE: As we'll come back to in more detail link:#entries_and_jsxpath[later], each time the client calls `React.CLIENT.render` or `.hydrate`, it will create a *separate root react app*. This is the outcome for each time a controller calls `React4xp.render` with the _request_ argument (omitting _request_ forces a pure serverside rendering without hydration). So in this example, there will be one independent react app in the client for each of the _color_ Parts you added to the Region.

[[free_structure]]
== 4: Free source file structure

So far, every time we've referenced a _.jsx_ react component from react4xp in a controller, we've used a `component` object in the _entry_ argument of `React4xp.render`. This is just a shortcut, and it depends on an "XP-conventional" naming regime to work: the _.jsx_ source file must be in the same folder as the controller, and have the same name.

It doesn't have to be that way. In this example, we'll take a look at which react components are available to `React4xp.render` - called *entries* in react4xp - and how to reference them, whatever they're called and wherever they're located.

A link:#entries_and_jsxpath[detailed summary] follows after the examples.

{zwsp} +

=== Below _site/_

Below the folder _src/main/resources/site/_, all source files with the extension _.jsx_ are detected at compile-time and available as entries to react4xp. If you take the *path relative to _resources/_* and the file name without the extension, you get a string that can be used to point react4xp to that react component:

- `"site/parts/hello-react/hello-react"` -> _src/main/resources/site/parts/hello-react/hello-react.jsx_
- `"site/parts/color/color"` -> _src/main/resources/site/parts/color/color.jsx_
- `"site/parts/color/differentEntry"` -> _src/main/resources/site/parts/color/differentEntry.jsx_

...etc.

These strings are called *jsxPaths* in react4xp, and they can be used directly in controllers as the _entry_ argument. For example in the link:#color_part_controller[_color_ Part controller] from before:

.site/parts/color/color.es6
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
React4xp.render(
    component,
    props,
    request,
    options
);
----

...is equivalent to:

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
React4xp.render(
    "site/parts/color/color",
    props,
    request,
    options
);
----

And so on. Calling the _.jsx_ source file something else, or having it in a different folder, is fine as long as you refer it correctly like this.

NOTE: _jsxPaths_ are name strings, not relative paths! You can't refer to _color.jsx_ from _color.es6_ as `"color"` or `"./color"` etc.

TIP: If you look at the rendered HTML output in page source, you can see React4xp using the jsxPaths to refer to the compiled assets from the client - even if you used the `component` object in the _entry_ argument.

TIP: All the _entries_ in your project are listed with their _jsxPath_ after compilation, in _build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/entries.json_.


{zwsp} +

=== Below _react4xp/_
If you just want to keep your react components out of the regular XP file structure in _site/_ and be independent of the structure of Parts, Pages etc, the folder _src/main/resources/react4xp/_ is meant for that. Here's how (assuming you're generally following link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/0.9.0/README.adoc#setup-option-2-using-react4xp-in-an-existing-project[the recommended setup pattern] used in the react4xp starter):

Open _react4xp.properties_ in the project root, and look for the property `entryDirs`. This is a (comma-separated) list of folder names *relative to the _react4xp/_ folder*. React4xp comes with a built-in suggestion here: `entryDirs = entries`. This means that all _.jsx_ (and _.js_ and _.es6_) source files below _src/main/resources/react4xp/entries_ will become entries: react components available to react4xp.

They will get a *_jsxPath_ relative to the closest _entryDirs_ folder*.

So for example if `entryDirs = entries`, then the closest _entryDirs_ folder is _src/main/resources/react4xp/entries_, and any XP controller can render _src/main/resources/react4xp/entries/subFolder/myEntry.jsx_ like this:

[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
React4xp.render(
    "subFolder/myEntry",
    props,
    request,
    options
);
----

TIP: *Under the _site/_ folder, entry source files must have the extension _.jsx_*. This is because regular XP source files can have _.js_ and _.es6_ extensions, and must be separated since the compilation and handling is very different. However, *under the _entryDirs_ folder(s), entries can have _.js_ and _.es6_ extensions too!*

NOTE: React4xp doesn't currently separate between different _entryDirs_, they behave as one. So if `entryDirs = entries,moreEntries` then _react4xp/entries/foo/bar.jsx_ and  _react4xp/moreEntries/foo/bar.jsx_ will get the same _jsxPath_: `"foo/bar"`. Beware of *namespace collisions*; you won't be able to refer to both.


{zwsp} +

=== Anywhere else

The _entryDirs_ are paths relative to _src/main/resources/react4xp/_, so just use relative _entryDirs_ if you need entries outside of that.

For example, say you've added an NPM package _externalComponents_ with react components in a _comps_ subfolder, and you want to use them as entries. Simply add it to _entryDirs_:

.react4xp.properties
[source,options="nowrap"]
----
entryDirs=entries,../../../../../node_modules/externalComponents/comps
----

(Or replace _entries_ if you're not using it, of course)

[[entries_and_jsxpath]]
== Entries and jsxPath

For reference, here are some more details about what _entries_ and their _jsxPath_ are:

[[entries]]
====

*ENTRIES*

React4xp is structured around _entries_. An entry is just *a React component that can be accessed by react4XP* in an XP controller. They are the _only_ react files that react4xp can use directly!

{zwsp} +

Entries are pretty much just standard JSX files, but they must follow *two requirements* (link:media/entries_howto.png[cheatsheet]):

1. *default-exports a function*, this function _may_ take a `props` argument (serializable JS object) and _must_ return a react component (pure functional component or old-school React Component), and
2. is located either in a folder either below *_/site/_* or below one of the *entryDirs* folders listed in _react4xp.properties_ (see also _jsxPath_ below).

{zwsp} +

Think of *entries as "bridge elements"*:

.A mental model (image links to another cheatsheet):
image:entries.png[link="media/entries_cheatsheet.png",title="React4xp Entries basic structure. Controllers can use entries, entries can import anything", width=600px]

On the XP/server side, you have the controllers with their backend XP flow, logic and XP lib imports. Entries are the beginning of the frontend side (although the same code is also used for serverside-rendering): they do regular frontend-style ES6 logic and can *import* stuff from NPM/node_modules, your own logic, nested react components, whatever - even other entries.

{zwsp} +

React4xp handles them in build-time and runtime: locates entries, compiles them into *entry assets* (under _/build/resources/main/assets/react4xp_), and serves them to the client.

Each entry becomes a separate *root level react app*. Good to know if you display more than one entry on a page - which you can, but you might also consider using just one entry for the root, and multiple imports in it.

For example, earlier in this tutorial we've seen the entries _hello-react.jsx_ and _color.jsx_, they are compiled into the assets _hello-react.js_ and _color.js_.
====

{zwsp} +

[[jsxPath]]
====
*JSX PATH*

Each entry is identified by its own _jsxPath_.

Short and brutal: the jsxPath is a name string generated from the path and filename of the compiled asset after building, relative to _/build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/_ - without file extension.

During development though, these *3 rules* are probably easier:

1. If you use the `component` object like in link:#hello_react_page[the first example], you can ignore the jsxPath. `React4xp.render` will use the component object to find an entry with the same folder/same name as a part/page/layout controller.

But if you need to access an entry from a different folder - from anywhere actually - here's *how to find the jsxPath of an entry*:

[start=2]
2. If an entry's source file is a JSX under _/src/main/resources/_ *_site/_*, the jsxPath is the source file's path relative to _/src/main/resources/_ - unix-style and without file extension.
* So the jsxPath will start with `site/...` etc (and the asset will be compiled into a folder below _/build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/_ *_site/_*, and so on).
3. Or, using the setup from the starter, you can also put your entries under _src/main/resources/_ *_react4xp/entries_*. Then the jsxPath (and compiled-asset path) will be relative to _/entries/_ instead.
* Actually, you can control this with the `entryDirs` property in _react4xp.properties_. The starter has added `entryDirs=entries` here, but this is a comma-separated list of folder names relative to _src/main/resources/react4xp/_. Remember, if you add more entryDirs or replace `entries`, the jsxPaths will always be relative to those new entryDirs.

* *For example:* add `../myComponents` to entryDirs: `entryDirs=entries,../myComponents`. Since entryDirs and the "../" are relative to _src/main/resources/react4xp/_, the new entry source folder is _src/main/resources/myComponents/_. Now new JSX files can be put there, and get a jsxPath relative to that. So the entry _src/main/resources/myComponents/_ *_app/myEntry.jsx_* will get the jsxPath `"app/myEntry"`, and will be compiled to the entry asset _/build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/app/myEntry.js_.

If you're ever unsure: after building, all the *jsxPaths of all the available entries* are stored in _build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/entries.json_. This file is generated by webpack during build. It's also used by the runtime, so it shouldn't be deleted or edited!

NOTE: jsxPaths are not actually file system paths, but *static name strings*. So avoid shortcuts and relative references like `../`, etc.
====




Okay, time to move on to the next example and lesson!

{zwsp} +
{zwsp} +

[[custom_flow]]
== 5: Custom flow

In this example things get a bit more complex. We'll make another Part, and re-use the Page controller, Template and Content type we made link:#_template_with_react_page_controller[previously].

1. However, we won't use the `React4xp.render` shorthand function from before. Instead, we'll look at a more *explicit react4xp syntax*:
  - It constructs one or more *data-holding React4xp objects*. This gives you better control and opportunities for logic steps when you handle your link:#entries[JSX entry]; you can manipulate the object(s) or extract data from them _before_ rendering.
  - Here, each entry is rendered in *two separate methods*: `renderBody` and `renderPageContributions`.
  - You can pretty easily render *multiple entries* from the same controller, by chaining together their rendering.

2. We will also use a *thymeleaf* template for one of the entries - and take advantage of the react4xp data object to send its ID to the thymeleaf model - just to demonstrate a way to combine react and thymeleaf rendering.

3. In addition to chain-rendering more than one entry, we will use the _jsxPath_ link:#jsxPath[as described above] to point to entries in a *different location*. Actually, let's just recycle the entries from before:


.Files involved:
[source,files]

    custom-flow/            <!--1-->
        custom-flow.xml

    hello-react/
        hello-react.jsx     <!--3-->
----

<1> The new Part we're making, _custom-flow_.
<2> The already existing entry link:#color_jsx[_color.jsx_]: a different folder from our _custom-flow_ Part, and different name.
<3> We're also reusing another existing entry link:#hello_react_jsx_modified[_hello-react.jsx_] (with props, not the first hardcoded one), located under _site/*pages*/hello-react/_. So even though what we're making here is a Part, an entry from a Page, or anywhere, is fine: when using jsxPaths, all entries are equal.


{zwsp} +

=== Code


*The Part definition* again defines some base data for us to play with. This is exactly the same definitions as before, just merged together into one Part: the greeting and bottle/thing counter from _hello-react.xml_, and the color from _color.xml_.

.custom-flow.xml:
[source,xml,options="nowrap"]

            <default>99</default>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>

----

Next, we're adding a *thymeleaf view template*:

This forms the initial HTML base, with `color` and `targetId` inserted by thymeleaf. This is actually not different from before: link:#first_helloreact_jsx[previously] we've used a hardcoded string as the HTML base that react is rendered into. Now we're just letting thymeleaf make it. Same thing, the base HTML string can come from anywhere.

The controller will render _two_ entries into this base HTML. To be clear: even though we're using two entries, this is still _one single XP Part_. The first entry is _color.jsx_ which will be inserted into the element `<div data-th-id="${targetId}"></div>`. The second one, _hello-react.jsx_ will also be rendered and inserted into this base HTML, but it will have a react4xp-ID that does not match any element ID here. This will cause react4xp to revert to the default behavior: generate a new container `<div>` and insert it right at the end of the root element: after `</section>` here:

.custom-flow-view.html:
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<div class="custom-flow-view">
    <section class="color-section">
        <h2 data-th-text="|Ain't nothing but a ${color} thing|"></h2>
        <p>Here it comes:</p>
        <div data-th-id="${targetId}"></div>
    </section>
</div>
----

*The controller* now has more complexity than before, so here's an overview:

- Each entry is used to set up a data-holding reactxp object, in steps _before the rendering_ is called. In these steps, data (options and props) can be both injected into the react4xp objects, and extracted from them.
- The output of one rendering is used as the base for the next; chaining them together and gradually building up the final output.
- HTML body and page contributions are rendered separately for each entry. So there is one multi-entry flow for body, and another for page contributions.

----
<1> Constructing the data-holding react4XP object `helloObj` from the _hello-react.jsx_ entry we finalized link:#hello_react_jsx_modified[before]. The constructor takes one argument, which is mandatory: an link:#entries[entry reference]. This can be an XP `component` object like before, OR like we're doing here: a link:#jsxPath[jsxPath]. This entry reference is used the same way as the first argument, _entry_, in link:#_react4xp_render[`React.render`].
<2> `setProps` modifies `helloObj`, to add some `props`. This corresponds to the second argument, _props`, in `React4xp.render`.
<3> After creating a react4xp object `colorObj` for the second entry, _color.jsx_, we're modifying that too, starting with adding props. Note the *builder-like pattern* here: each of the setter methods (`setProps`, `setId` and `uniqueId`) returns the react4xp object itself. This allows you to run them directly after each other like this, so this example is just a shorter way of writing `colorObj.setProps({ color: partConfig.color });  colorObj.setId("myColorThing");  colorObj.uniqueId();`.
<4> `setId` sets the ID of the react4xp object and the target element that the rendering will look for in the HTML. If an ID has previously been set for the react4xp object, `setId` will overwrite it.
<5> `uniqueId` makes sure the react4xp object has a globally unique ID. It can work in two ways. If an ID has not been set previously, a simple random ID is generated. If an ID _has_ been set, like here in step 4, the random number is appended after the existing ID. So the order between `setId` and `uniqueId` matters - what we get here is _"myColorThing"_ plus a random number (separated by an underscore), giving us something recognizable in the output but still ensuring that the element ID is not repeated in cases where this part is used more than once on a page. Had `setId` been run after `uniqueId`` however, `setId` would just overwrite the previous unique ID with the supplied string - and possibly repeated.
<6> So, since there's a random component in the ID string of the react4xp object and we want that ID to match a specific element in the HTML, we read the ID from `colorObj.react4xpId` and inject it into the thymeleaf template as `targetId`.
<7> We render `colorObj` into a new HTML string, based on the HTML output of the thymeleaf rendering...
<8> ...and render the page contributions for activating it in the client. We add a small extra script just to demonstrate that extra pageContributions can be added in `renderPageContributions` as well, by passing them through as before. Now we have both the HTML body and page contributions from the first entry, _color.jsx_.
<9> But we're going to add a second entry to this Part, just because we can. That entry's going to be clientside rendered (as opposed to _color.jsx_ which gets serverside-rendered because no `clientRender` was flagged). However, since this syntax doesn't automatically handle inside-content-studio rendering (unlike link:#_react4xp_render[React4xp.render] which does handle that), we need to determine if this rendering is happening inside or outside Content Studio.
<10> Rendering the HTML body of second entry, _hello-react.jsx_, into the HTML body from the first entry: `colorBody` from before. ID and target element is handled the same way as in `React4xp.render`: since no ID is set (we created `helloObj` without running `.setId`) a random ID will be used. And since that ID doesn't match any ID in the base HTML `body` (`colorBody`), the rendering will just create a target container element inside the root element of `colorBody`, after other content. We're letting the value of `clientRender` depend on whether or not we're rendering inside Content Studio (if we are, then `isOutsideContentStudio` is `false` and serverside-rendering is forced, while we get clientside rendering outside).
<11> Rendering the activating page contributions for `helloObj`, adding them to the previous `colorPageContributions` by passing them through the rendering. We're using the same `clientRender: isOutsideContentStudio` here too:

[NOTE]
====
*The rendering mode (client- or serverside) must match* between `renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions` for an entry!

This is on an entry-by-entry basis, there's no problem mixing multiple entries in the same controller like in this example, where one entry is serverside and the other is clientside rendered - as long as `clientRender` matches for each entry's body and page contributions.
====

And we're done, our new _custom-flow_ Part is now ready.

{zwsp} +

=== Setup

All of this amounted to a new Part, _custom-flow_. It can be added to any Region, so just follow link:#adding_parts_to_new_content[the same setup steps] in Content Studio to add and see it.

Again, if you add more than one _custom-flow_ Part to a Region, you'll see that they are independent both in behavior and Output; separated by their unique ID.

[[imports_chunks]]
== 6: Imports and dependency chunks

Finally, a slightly more life-like example. Looking at these features:

- We'll stay with the syntax from the previous example. That lets us make a part with *multiple entries* - both different entries and re-using multiple instances of the same entry. In the previous example we saw how to pass `body` and `pageContributions` through a rendering step. Here, we'll use that for *chaining*: builing them gradually by passing them through the rendering steps of all the entries.
- *Importing stuff* into entries - third-party JS libs etc, nested react components, etc, or nesting an entry in another.
- *Dependency chunks*: using only source folder structure, we can easily get webpack to compile and pack code into controlled bundles, e.g. code that's frequently used together in the client, served in an optimized way by XP.

.react4xp/entries/mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry.jsx:
[source,JavaScript]
----
import React from 'react';

import BuilderClicker from '../../myChunk/BuilderClicker';

export default (props) => <div className="builderclicker-entry">
		<BuilderClicker {...props} />
	</div>;
----

Some repetition from before: remember how *JSX files below `react4xp/entries` will be compiled to entries, with a jsxPath relative to that folder and without the file extension*? So this will be an entry with the jsxPath `mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry`.

It's functionally pretty slim, it doesn't do much except import another React component, `react4xp/myChunk/BuilderClicker` and pass the props down to it. Since `BuilderClicker` is not under `react4xp/entries`, it's not an entry and can't be used by React4XP. Which is why it needs an entry like this.


*A slightly heavier, non-entry React component:*

.react4xp/myChunk/BuilderClicker.jsx:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

class BuilderClicker extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            first: props.first,
            second: props.second,
        }
    };

    // Doubles the 'first' or 'second' string in state, depending on the key.
    makeMore = (key) => {
        this.setState({[key]: this.state[key] + " " + this.state[key]});
    };

    render() {
        return <div className="builderclicker">
            <h3 style={{color:"green"}}>
                <span onClick={() => this.makeMore('first')}
                      style={{cursor: "pointer"}}
                      className="first">{this.state.first}
                </span> <span onClick={() => this.makeMore('second')}
                      style={{cursor: "pointer"}}
                      className="second">{this.state.second}</span>
            </h3>
        </div>;
    }
};

export default (props) => <BuilderClicker {...props} />;
----


`BuilderClicker` displays two texts in one line, and builds more by doubling each of the texts whenever they are clicked in the browser.

This is a _non-entry_ React component, that will be imported by several of the entries in this example (`BuilderClickerEntry` is one of them). Because of its source file location, `BuilderClicker` will be compiled into a highly reuseable, optimized and auto-handled chunk called `myChunk`:

==== Chunks:


*JSX files that are _not_ under `site/` or `react4xp/_entries` won't be compiled into entries*. They don't have a jsxPath, and *need to be imported by an entry* to be used in React4XP (or to be precise: they must be part of an import tree with an entry on top).

*Everything that's imported from files in other subfolders below `react4xp/` will be compiled into chunks*. These are "sub-library" code bundles with the same name as the subfolder. They are *optimized* for repeated loading and runtime import, and cached for reuse, with a cache-busting content hash added to the file name.

Chunks are made to be *fire-and-forget:* you don't need to handle them in any way after naming the subfolders and importing the contents correctly. React4xp takes care of them during serving, caching and server-side rendering.

One recommended usage - an entry as a bridge between React4xp and more heavyweight React components:

[TIP]
====
*Since the chunks are most optimized, it's recommended to keep the entries slim and put as much of the heavy and reusable stuff as possible into chunks.* Also, it's best to keep the non-entries in chunks: each JSX entry is compiled to its own separate JS file. If an entry imports a non-entry piece of code that's _not in a chunk either_, it will just be compiled into the entry's JS "bundle", making it more heavy-weight.
====


*Another entry in the part:*

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.jsx:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';
import BuilderClickerEntry from '../../../react4xp/_entries/mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry';

export default (props) => <BuilderClickerEntry {...props} />;
----

Three things to note here:

* An entry can import and nest another entry just fine (if you should ever need to),
* The same React component, `BuilderClicker`, is imported from its chunk more than once in the same part (but only loaded once in the client),
* The two instances of it are functional and independent in the client. The fact that it's imported into the part through two different entries doesn't matter for this - we'll show this by using _this_ entry twice in the controller.


*The part definition* doesn't define anything editorial this time:

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.xml:
[source,xml]
----
<part>
  <display-name>Chaining</display-name>
  <description>Multiple react components, chaining, nesting, hydration</description>
  <form />
</part>
----


*The part view* has two target containers (with hardcoded IDs) and a horizontal divider, and clearly expects some more containers to be added:

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.html:
[source,html,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<div class="chaining-example">
    <h1>04 - Chaining Example</h1>
    <p>These two target containers existed in the HTML:</p>
    <div id="a-target-container"></div>
    <div id="another-target-container"></div>

    <hr style="display:block; margin:20px; width:100%; height:1px; border:1px dotted #aaa;"/>
    <p>The rest of the containers don't exist before rendering, but are inserted at the end:</p>
</div>
----


And finally, the juicy part controller:


.site/parts/chaining/chaining.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

const view = resolve("chaining.html");

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const clientRender = (request.mode !== 'edit' && request.mode !== 'inline'); <!--1-->


    const firstReact4xpObj = new React4xp('mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry') <!--2-->
        .setId("a-target-container")
        .setProps({
            first: "Click",
            second: "ME!"
        });

    const secondReact4xpObj = new React4xp(component) <!--3-->
        .setId("another-target-container")
        .setProps({
            first: "No click ME!",
            second: "I do the exact same thing only better!"
        });

    // ------------------------------ A horizontal separator comes here in the view:
    // a new section where React4XP generates and inserts target containers where the
    // IDs didn't exist in the HTML


    const thirdReact4xpObj = new React4xp(component) <!--4-->
        .setId("a-third-container-doesnt-exist-but-will-be-generated") <!--5-->
        .setProps({
            first: "Here I am.",
            second: "Again."
        });


    let body = thymeleaf.render(view, {});

    body = firstReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body }); <!--6-->
    body = secondReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body, clientRender });
    body = thirdReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body });

    let pageContributions = firstReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions();
    pageContributions = secondReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions({
    	pageContributions,
    	clientRender
    });
    pageContributions = thirdReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });


    ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].forEach(cardinalNum => {	<!--7-->
        const notUniqueComp = new React4xp(
            	'site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'
            )
            .setId('this-is-not-unique')
            .setProps({ greetee: `${cardinalNum} repeated thing`});

        body = notUniqueComp.renderBody({ body });
        pageContributions = notUniqueComp.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });
    });


    ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].forEach(cardinalNum => {
        const uniqueComp = new React4xp(
            	'site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'
            )
            .setId('this-id-is-unique').uniqueId() <!--8-->
            .setProps({ greetee: `${cardinalNum} unique thing`});

        body = uniqueComp.renderBody({body});
        pageContributions = uniqueComp.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });
    });


    return { <!--9-->
        body,
        pageContributions: clientRender ?
            pageContributions :
            undefined,
    };
};

----


<1> *Content Studion and client-side rendering/hydration:* Just like we did in the previous example, it's a good idea to respond to XP's viewing mode: are the react components being displayed inside Content Studio (request.mode is 'edit' or 'inline')? If so, the client-side JS of Content  Studio may clash with react's JS. We're making a boolean `clientRender` for common control of all the entries in this part. This allows client-side rendering and hydration only outside Content Studio, and makes React4xp render static and un-hydrated HTML visualizations inside Content Studio - giving a visualization everywhere but activation only outside of Content Studio. Repetition: the `React4xp.render` shorthand function does all this automatically, if you prefer that.
<2> Importing `BuilderClicker` from `myChunk` a first time, through `BuilderClickerEntry`...
<3> ...and a sceond time, through the part's own entry (referred by `component`) which nests `BuilderClickerEntry`...
<4> ...and a third time, through the same part's own entry again.
<5> From here on down, none of the IDs will exist as target element IDs in the body. React4XP auto-handles this by inserting them at the end of `body`, in the order of chaining:
<6> *Chaining:* First creates a `body` starting point from the local Thymeleaf template. This is _passed through_ the `.renderBody` method of all the React4XP objects, each one expanding `body` by inserting either just a container element (`clientRender`) or rendering more React into it. `firstReact4xpObj` and `thirdReact4xpObj` will be server-side-rendered, `secondReact4xpObj` will be client-side-rendered. Note how *the `clientRender` parameter matches for each React4XP object*, between the `renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions` calls in the next step. `.renderPageContributions` works the same way: a `pageContributions` object is expanded with activating scripts for each time it passes through a React4XP object. `.renderPageContributions` only appends what's necessary, so that shared components and chunks etc aren't loaded more than once in the client.
<7> Making 4 unique React4XP objects from the same entry, with different props, and adding them to the chain. _They all have the same ID_ (`'this-is-not-unique'`), so they will be rendered and overwritten into the same container element - so only the last one of them survives and is visible.
<8>	So the lesson is to force the IDs to be unique, by adding a `.uniqueId()` call in each iteration. Now that the IDs are different, and they each get their own container element and all four are visibly rendered.
<9> And finally, outputting the results of the chain (although the pageContributions are skipped inside Content Studio).

[NOTE]
====
In this example we're making a new React4xp object for each rendering. An object can in principle be re-rendered, *but rendering a body or pageContribution will lock the ID* of the object.

In other words: we can use an _entry_ multiple times target1ing different container elements by using different React4XP objects. And we can render the same _React4XP object_ into the same container multiple times (if we should need to). But *trying to change the ID and target element will throw an error after an object's first rendering.*

=== Setup


Add this part the same way as in the previous examples and look at it in the Preview - you should see this:

[.thumb]
image:chaining2.png[title="You clicked, Sir? Why, I am but a humble screenshot!" width=1036px]

The few things worth confirming here:

* A *many-to-many relationship*: all of the entries and React4xp objects were visualized by a single part here. And some of the entries have been used in other parts and across several React4xp objects.
* This is but a humble screenshot, but in the actual Preview outside of Content Studio, the green rendered `BuilderClicker` instances are now *active* and respond to clicks as defined in `BuilderClicker`: clicking the first or second half of each of them doubles the clicked text (this activation happened in the `.hydrate` steps for server-side rendered entries, and in the actual rendering for client-side rendered ones).
* The clicks and reponses are *isolated* to the instance that was actually clicked: even though they are technically the same entry `BuilderClicker`, they each have their own state. This is not because `BuilderClicker` is nested differently in them, but because their ID's are different,
* There's only one "...repeated thing" but four "...unique thing", as explained above (point 7 and 8 in the controller code)

=== Output

*The output page source* to the client is much longer now. If you want to dive into that, it would look something like this:

----


Just confirming what you surely guessed would happen:

<1> While the first and third React4XP objects were server-side rendered and hydrated, the second one was client-side rendered into an empty container.
<2> Several of the containers that were output weren't defined in the original Thymeleaf template, and were only rendered because the ID wasn't found.
<3> Only one container with _"this-is-not-unique"_ was rendered for the same reason: that ID had already been inserted. So all the corresponding React4XP objects were server-side rendered into that one. This would also happen with client-side rendering! Also look further down: the client is asked to `hydrate` all four instances, which will log errors in the console since the content doesn't match.
<4> React4xp automatically traced the dependency to `myChunk.<hash>.js` and added this import to the page contributions because that's where `BuilderClicker` comes from.
<5> Although several of the generated assets are _used_ more than once, the page contributions are trimmed for duplicates so each of them are only _downloaded to the client_ once.

== Need to go deeper?

Thats _most_ of what React4XP offers. For more technical details, some corner-case features, adaptability and more complex functionality, we will shortly release on the Enonic pages a full API overview and other in-depth documentation for the library and build setup.
