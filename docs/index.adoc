Build sites and apps that support client- and serverside JSX templating with the React framework, in combination with optimized asset serving and hydration - for lighting fast sites and apps.

== Introduction

React4XP integrates React with the CMS components in Content Studio, and allows reuse of JSX templates for both back-end, front-end and editorial use cases. It builds directly on top of traditional XP controllers, making JSX look like any other templating engine out there, while expanding the possibilities for single-page sites and client-side driven apps when needed.

This documentation takes you through the basic elements of React4XP and how to use the starter, helping you kickstart a React4xp project of your own.

Essential features you will learn about:

* How to
* What is
* And then some...

[NOTE]
====
This starter and guide aims for setting up React4xp with *XP 7*. An XP6-compatible version will be released shortly. If you're using XP6 and the XP6 starter, only the installation is different from XP7 - and the XP6 starter handles those differences. Using React4xp the rest of the way is identical, so *you can still use this guide for both versions.*

=== What is React4xp?

React4xp is a suite of tools: a library with a few companion NPM packages. They should cover many use cases, and can of course be used separately or be modified to suit your needs.

But primarily, *it's built to work together out of the box to make it as easy as possible to integrate React with Enonic XP*, by handling:

- component compilation/building,
- inserting editorial data into react components,
- isomorphic serverside and clientside rendering and hydration,
- optimizing and serving reusable asset chunks to the client side,
- component reference from anywhere

This guide focuses on the react4xp starter, which handles a full basic setup. But it can also be imported into an existing XP project - the core library docs have https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/master/README.md#installing-the-library[a guide for that].


== Get started

=== Create a starter project

To setup a project locally, run the following command:

  enonic project create -r starter-react4xp

Remember to create a *new XP sandbox* when completing the project wizard.

NOTE: *Don't have the Enonic CLI?* Visit the https://developer.enonic.com/start[Getting started guide] to install it.


=== Build and Deploy

To build and deploy the app, run this command from your shell:

  enonic project deploy

Accept starting the sandbox.

[NOTE]
====
To verify that your app started successfully, you should find an entry similar to this in the sandbox log:

  2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [<name.of.your.app>] installed successfully

== Project structure

If you're used to working with an https://developer.enonic.com/guides/my-first-webapp[ordinary] XP project with https://developer.enonic.com/templates/webpack[webpack], the structure will look familiar - the biggest news is the folder `react4xp/` under `resources/`. Your project folder should now look something like this:

.Selected files:
[source,files]
----
build.gradle <--1-->
settings.gradle <--1-->
package.json <--2-->
build/ <--3-->
src/
  main/
    resources/
      assets/ <!--4-->
      react4xp/ <!--5-->
        _entries <!--6-->
          REPLACE_ME.jsx <!--7-->
      site/
        parts/ <!--8-->
        pages/ <!--8-->
        REPLACE_ME.jsx <!--7-->
      webapp/ <!--9-->
----


<1> The gradle files are used by the build system. The starter includes some setup here: the library *lib-react4xp* and some building tasks that use webpack with configs that are fetched with NPM.
<2> `package.json` sets up NPM package import
<3> `build/` will contain output files produced by the build. All the output from the react4xp build process (along with a few housekeeping data files) will be compiled into the subfolder `build/resources/main/assets/react4xp`. These built assets are used in runtime both on client- and server side.
<4> But note that `assets/react4xp` is NOT the source of those React4xp assets! Just use `assets/` for other, general, non-react4xp static assets such as css and icons, etc.
<5> `react4xp/` is the general folder for react component source files. React4xp will look for `.js` and `.jsx` files here and in all subfolders, and compile them during build. All subfolders below this (except for `_entries` - see below) will be compiled to *chunks* with the same name as the subfolder. Put nested/reused react components in subfolders like that, and also other code imported by your components.
<6> `react4xp/_entries/` is special and magic. This is the main folder for *entry components* - react components that can be used directly by React4xp, that is, they don't need to be nested inside other react components.
<7> Two `REPLACE_ME.jsx` files: simply placeholders needed by webpack. Removed each of these when you've added one or more react source file below `react4xp/_entries/` and `site/`.
<8> Below the `site/parts/` and `site/pages/` subfolders is where you put your XP parts and pages, as always. With React4xp, *you can also put `.jsx` entry components together with your parts and pages*. This is the easiest use case: if they have the same name as the part/page, they are super easy to inject into the part/page from the controller.
<9> Folder containing the root webapp controller. React4xp supplies services that allow even static HTML pages to refer to and request compiled React4xp components.

NOTE: *Where you put your entry source files in this structure is important!* Look for `jsxPath` in the examples below, or check out more details in https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/master/README.md#jsxpath-how-to-refer-to-a-react4xp-component[the main library docs].


== Usage overview

=== Four ways

Simply put, there are 4 prototypical usage patterns. You're not bound to use them exactly like this, but for clarity here's an overview:

. *The easiest* is to put one entry source file into the same folder as a part/page where it should be displayed, and let it have the same file name as the part/page (but `.JSX` extension only!). Let the React4xp shorthand functions `.renderSafe` (for client-side rendering) or `.render` (for server-side rendering and client-side hydration) use XP's `request` and `getComponent()` to figure out the messy stuff for you. Tweak the rendering functions with extra parameters if you want. The output from these render functions is a full response object with everything the client needs to display it - just return it directly.
. Or if you want to *reuse an entry component in multiple parts or pages* (or just, not be bound by the part/page they 'belong to' in the parent folder): put a source file where you want: either a `.JSX` file in any page/part folder or a `.JS`/`.JSX`/`.ES6` under `react4xp/_entries` (#6 in the structure overview above). React4xp uses the location of all components to derive a name for each of them: the *jsxPath*. You can see the built jsxPaths in `build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/entries.json`. Use `.render` or `.renderSafe`, but with the jsxPath string instead of the `getComponent` object.
. Or if you need more *flexibility and control, want to insert logic or extract data while constructing the component, or want to use more than one entry component in a single part or page*: instead of using the shorthands `.render` or `.renderSafe`, create a temporary data-holding `new React4xp(...)` object in the page/part controller. When you're done manipulating, the React4xp object has built-in and specific methods for rendering a body and the necessary page contributions, for client-side or server-side react rendering.
. Finally, *React4xp can be used without XP controllers* if needed: a few services are exposed in runtime, endpoints where a client can request runnable compiled code:
  - entries, by jsxPath reference,
  - chunks (and lists of chunks), referred by the jsxPath(s) used on a page,
  - a client-side React4xp wrapper, simplifying these manual clientside steps and triggering rendering,
  - React and ReactDOM themselves, the versions used on the serverside. Handy if you're doing SSR and want to be sure it's always the exact same versions doing the rendering everywhere.
  - This allows you for example to bypass Content Studio if you want, using XP's webapp functionality.

=== Imports and chunks
When building your react components, *you can import JS/ES6 code as usual*: nested react components, your own secondary code, other frameworks, libraries, whatever... Imported code can be compiled into separate asset chunks from the entries that use them, for https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/[code splitting].

This chunking is easy to control: *put the imported sources in chunk-named subfolders below the `react4xp/` folder* (outside of `_entries`). Done this way, React4xp will handle:

 - optimized building and serving of the entries and chunks,
 - client-and-server-side caching with cache busting,
 - keep track of exactly which secondary chunks are needed for displaying which component entries,
 - and add the necessary client-side script requests/imports along with the response.

https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/master/README.md#entries-and-dependency-chunks[More about entries and chunks in the core library documentation].

TIP: Chunks are more optimized than entries. Ideally, keep the served entries slim and leave the heavy lifting to chunks.
