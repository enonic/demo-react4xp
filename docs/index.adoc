== Introduction

This tutorial will show you step-by-step how to build XP sites and apps with React rendering, helping you kickstart a React4xp project of your own.

During this exercise you will:

- set up the starter and meet the React4xp library,
- learn how to use it to render a basic React component from any regular XP controller,
- inject editorial data into your React component,
- see how to point the controller to the React components - and where to put them in your project source,
- dig a little deeper into ways of controlling the rendering,


== React4XP

image::react4xp.svg["React4xp logo" 256px]

This starter is based on *React4XP*, which is a library (with a companion build structure) that facilitates use of React in Enonic XP, and:

* enables you to use JSX as a templating language, similar to other XP templating engines
* supports isomorphic client- or serverside rendering and hydration,
* handles build flow and compilation with automated optimized asset serving
* is modular and tweakable, making it possible to pop the hood, pick it apart and set things up your own way. Godspeed!
* is flexible enough to cover many advanced use cases,


== Setup

=== Create project

Set up the starter project locally. With Enonic XP 7, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
enonic project create -r starter-react4xp
----

Remember to create a *new XP sandbox* when completing the project wizard.

[TIP]
====
*Don't have the Enonic CLI?* Visit the https://developer.enonic.com/start[Getting started guide] to install it.

*Only want to inject react4xp into your own XP project?* The https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/blob/master/README.md[lib-react4xp docs] have a section on how to do without the starter. But it's recommended to go through this introduction first.
====


=== Project structure

If you're used to working with a typical XP project using https://developer.enonic.com/templates/webpack[webpack], the structure in your project root folder will now look familiar -
the biggest news is the folder `resources/react4xp/`. This is just an overview, and you don't need to know it by heart to get started.

TIP: TL;DR: *just put your JSX source files under `react4xp/entries/` or under `site/`*, and you're ready to build and run.

[source,files]
----
build.gradle <--1-->
gradle.properties
settings.gradle
package.json
react4xp.properties <--2-->
src/
  main/
    resources/
      react4xp/ <!--3-->
        entries/
        shared/
      site/
        pages/
            default/ <!--4-->
              default.es6
              default.html
              default.xml
        parts/
          hello-react/ <!--5-->
            hello-react.es6
            hello-react.jsx
            hello-react.xml
----

<1> A set of gradle config files and `package.json`. These define the build process and project structure, and in particular, make sure that the *lib-react4xp library* and *react4xp npm package* are installed right.
<2> `react4xp.properties`: tune the most common properties of the react4xp project.
<3> The `react4xp/` folder is opt-in: doesn't need to contain anything, but when fine-tuning the build later we'll get back to why you might find it handy to have a separate place for some of your react components. The super-short version is that the `entries\` folder can have react components that can be used by react4xp, and the have `shared\` folder can contain common components shared between entries (entries can import any other react components).
<4> A bare-bone `default` page controller is included with the starter - both for convenience in general, and as a sandbox for some of the examples here,
<5> Also a simple `hello-react` part with a pre-made react view, for some other examples.

=== Build and Deploy

To build and deploy the starter app, run this command from your shell:

[source, bash]
----
enonic project deploy
----

Accept starting the sandbox.

[NOTE]
====
To verify that your app started successfully, you should find an entry similar to this in the sandbox log:

`2019-04-09 13:40:40,765 INFO ... Application [<name.of.your.app>] installed successfully`
====

Now, let's look at some usage examples - starting from the bottom.

== Hello React

React4xp is made to cover many ways of combining XP and react. Let's start with the simplest possible scenario: only displaying a working react component. We'll do this from a regular XP page controller we'll call _hello-react_.

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/pages/hello-react/
  hello-react.xml
  hello-react.jsx
  hello-react.es6
----

=== Code

First, we need a *page definition* XML file. Just XP boilerplate:

.hello-react.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<part>
  <display-name>Hello React</display-name>
  <description>Super simple example</description>
  <form />
</part>
----

Next, we'll add the *react component*. This displays only a "Hello world" message on the screen. But in order to demonstrate that what we get is a _working react_ component (not only using JSX as an XP templating language, although you could do that too if you want), we'll add some simple functionality to it: every time you click the message, it will print a counting-down message in the console:

.hello-react.jsx
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

let bottleCount = 99;

const dropBottle = () => {
    console.log(`${bottleCount--} bottles of beer on the wall`);
}

export default (props) => <p onClick={dropBottle}>Hello world</p>;
----

[NOTE]
====
One thing is mandatory for this to work, shown in the last line: the JSX file *must default-export a function* that *may take a props object* and *returns a react component*. Apart from that, you can use ordinary ES6 and import and nest other JS, react components and third-party stuff from node_modules in the regular way (there are a couple of caveats to this, we'll get back to that below).
====
Finally, we'll add a bare-bone *page controller* that calls the rendering engine:

.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');       // // <1>

exports.get = function(request) {                       // // <2>
    const entry = portal.getComponent();                // // <3>
    const props = null;

    return React4xp.render(                             // // <4>
        entry,
        props,
        request,
        {
            id: "react4xpApp",                          // // <5>
            body:                                       // // <6>
                `<html>
                    <body>
                        <div id="react4xpApp"></div>
                    </body>
                </html>`
        }
    );
};
----

That's it.

If you've used XP before, you'll probably note that there's no HTML view file, no `thymeleaf.render`, and so on - in this example, react4xp completely handles the page view. The essential thing here is that at the end of the `get` function, *react4xp in a single _.render_ call creates a _full_ XP response object, that makes react work.*

What's going on in the controller?

<1> In line 2, `React4xp` is imported from the library.
<2> In line 4, we pick up the `request` data. The render call needs it to know the rendering context.
<3> In line 5, we get the XP component data. Used directly in the `.render` call, it's a convenient shortcut for react4xp to "this XP component", for finding the same-name react component in the same folder: _hello-react.jsx_. React4xp has more ways to refer to react components, or _entries_ (we'll get to that under link:#_react4xp_render[the render call] and link:#_jsxpath[jsx paths]).
<4> In line 8, the juicy bit: *the actual render call*. The rendered response from it can be returned directly from the `get` function, since `.render` creates an object with a `body` HTML string and a `pageContributions` attribute with everything needed (more about this link:#_react4xp_render[below]).
<5> In line 13, the `id` attribute _"react4xpApp"_ is set in the *options* argument of `.render` (lines 12-20). This is the unique ID we're giving to the react component, and the HTML id of the target element where react will render the component in the end. Note that the same ID is found in an element in the HTML `body`:
<6> In lines 14-19, we're hardcoding a `body` option, an HTML string as a base for the output, with a _"react4xpApp"_ ID element. In many cases you can do without this string but here it's needed for the output, since react itself doesn't like to render the tags `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` or anything outside of a containing root tag (such as `<!DOCTYPE html>`).

=== React4xp.render

For context before we move on with the example, here's a closer look at the `.render` call:

====
React4xp's `.render` is a one-in-all shorthand function for a lot of use cases. Basically, take any HTML string and pass it through `.render` as a `body` option, and react4xp will insert the react component into the HTML string and add any necessary page contributions to make it all work.

*Signature*, analogous to thymeleaf's familiar `render(view, model`) signature - but with some extra parameters and a full XP response object returned:

`{body, pageContributions} = React4xp.render(entry, props, request, options);`

*Parameters:*

- `entry` (mandatory, string or component object): this is the reference to the react component to be rendered. If it's a JSX file in the same folder, with the same name, as an XP component, simply use the `portal.getComponent()` object here. In this example,  it's the _hello-react_ page, but you can do the same thing from a part or a layout controller. We'll come back to a more specific file reference anywhere in your code, under link:#_jsxpath[jsx path]. By the way, a react component that is used by react4xp this way is called link:#_entries[an entry].
- `props` (optional object, must be serializable): data passed into the react component.
- `request` (link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP request object], kind of optional, but _mandatory for react activation_): This is used to determine if the rendering happens inside XP content studio. If so (or if `request` is omitted), only static HTML is rendered, server-side - which means that no browser react activation (or client-side rendering) happens inside content studio, you only get a visualization from the initial `props`.
- `options` (optional object): additional options to control the rendering:

** `id` (string): ID of the component, matching the ID of an element in `body`. React will render into that container element, replacing whatever was already there. If missing, a random ID is generated.
** `body` (string): HTML string, a base for the returned `body`. Can be a hardcoded string, or come from a thymeleaf/mustache/XSLT render, and so on. Just make sure the `id` option matches an HTML id here (what happens if not? React4xp creates a target element with that ID, last in the root element of `body`). If there's no `body` option, a matching-ID `<div>` target container is generated.

** `pageContributions` (object): you might already have some page contributions you want to return together with the ones generated by react4xp. Same way as with `body`, just add them here to pass them through `render`. Order: the ones you add here are output before the ones rendered.
** `clientRender` (boolean): if `true` (truthy, actually), the server-side rendering is skipped (in live mode and previews. Inside content studio's browser or edit modes, you still only get a static server-side rendered representation).

*Returns* an link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/framework/http[XP response object] with these main attributes:

- `body`: rendered HTML string.
- `pageContributions`: a regular link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/xp/stable/cms/contributions[XP page contributions] object. Includes everything the browser needs to activate (or client-side render) the react component: auto-compiled assets for the entry (_hello-react.js_ in this example) and whatever it may depend on (most importantly, react and react-dom in an _externals_ asset), and a client-side react4xp wrapper asset. These are all optimized and served to the client by react4xp services.
====

`.render` is just one way. React4xp has other, more detailed ways of react4xp rendering, we'll get back to those.

'''

















Let's make a simple XP part that displays "Hello World", using a react component: `hello-react`.

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/parts/hello-react/
  hello-react.xml
  hello-react.jsx
  hello-react.es6
----



=== Code

Add a *part definition*. It doesn't need anything special, just XP boilerplate:

.hello-react.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<part>
  <display-name>Hello React</display-name>
  <description>Simple example with server-side rendering by default</description>
  <form />
</part>
----

Now for *the React component* itself:

.hello-react.jsx
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

export default (props) => <p>Hello {props.greetee}!</p>;
----

It takes a `greetee` prop and greets it with a booming "Hello"! This is our first example of an _Entry_:

=== Entries

*_Entries_ in React4XP are the React components that can be accessed by React4XP*. They are just any standard JSX file, as long as it:

. default-exports a function that takes an optional `props` parameter and returns a React element,
. is placed either under the folder `/react4xp/_entries`, or in a part or page folder under `site/`.

When done, they are automatically handled by React4XP and can be easily used in XP controllers:


The *part controller* uses React4XP to render the entry:

.hello-react.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();
    const props = { greetee: "world" };

    return React4xp.render(component, props, request);
};
----

It basically just imports `React4xp` and uses the `.render` function, similar to how you might be familiar with from Thymeleaf or other XP template engines:

* The first argument is a reference to the template. In our case the template is the React4XP entry, and React4XP uses the `component` data (for the part itself) to locate the JSX file in the part's own folder (expecting the same file name as the part).
* The second argument, `props`, is similar to the `model` argument in the Thymeleaf renderer. No big surprise: it's passed to the entry's `props`. Here is the _world_ we're about to greet.
* The third `request` argument is necessary for a fully activated React rendering. You _can_ leave it out to render the entry as pure HTML if you like JSX as a pure templating language, but it won't be activated (https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate[hydrated]) in the browser.

*The returned response object* from `.render` is sent straight from the controller to the client, and contains:

* a `body` field with a server-side rendering (in static HTML) of the entry with the entered props,
* and some `pageContributions` that make the client activate the React entry (containing the necessary asset links and React hydration commands).

[NOTE]
====
An important difference from Thymeleaf's renderer is that `React4XP.render` generates _a full response object_ that can be directly returned from the controller, instead of just HTML that you need to wrap in a `body` field in the controller's response object.
====

*That's it. This part is ready to display in XP!*


=== Setup

Let's add it to a page in Content Studio and render it:

* Run `enonic project deploy` from your shell, start the sandbox and point your browser to `localhost:8080/admin`.
* Log in to XP and open Content Studio.
* Create some content (e.g. a site with the Default Page controller included with the starter, or a https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/landingpage-lib[a landing page]). Anything with a Region will do.
* Insert the new part into the region, and select the `hello-react` part you just made.
* Enter the preview to view the content outside of Content Studio. You should now see:

[.thumb]
image::hello-world.png["Rendering: Hello World. In fabulous Times New Roman, because a good tutorial has no irrelevant layers of complexity.", width=492px]


=== Output

Curious about what happened here? *View the page source code in the browser* to see what `.render` created - something like this (the number-tagged lines):
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>(...)</head>

  <body>

    <main data-portal-region="main" class="xp-region">
      <div (...) id="parts_hello-react__main_0">
      	<p data-reactroot="">Hello <!-- -->world<!-- -->!</p> <!--1-->
      </div>
    </main>

    <script src="(...) /react4xp/externals.88e80cab5.js"></script>  <!--2-->
    <script src="(...) /react4xp-client/"></script> <!--3-->
    <script src="(...) /react4xp/site/parts/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script> <!--4-->
    <script defer> <!--5-->
      React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate(
        React4xp['site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'],
        "parts_hello-react__main_0",
        { "greetee": "world", "react4xpId": "parts_hello-react__main_0" }
      );
    </script>

   </body>
</html>
----

<1> A container element with an ID, and inside it: an HTML representation of the JSX entry, pre-rendered by React4XP on the server with the initial props.
<2> A standard `externals` chunk (the exact path may vary with local setups, so it's truncated to `(...)`. The same goes for the cache-busting hash in the filename). This contains React and ReactDOM, built-in with React4XP.
<3> The React4xp client wrapper, which enables the hydration command in point #5, among other things. A global client-side object is created, `React4xp`, which will contain all things React4xp in runtime. The client wrapper is `React4xp.CLIENT`.
<4> The entry itself - the compiled version of `hello-react.jsx`.
<5> Calling `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate`, the hydration of the entry along with a path pointer to the entry (we'll get back to this below, as the concept of _jsxPath_), the ID of the container element the entry is rendered into, and the props.

[NOTE]
====
We only added the `greetee` prop in the controller. The other one, `react4xpId`, is the unique ID of the component, same as the container element ID. It's always added as a prop for each entry, conveniently helping to separate multiple instances of the same component (e.g. allowing them to share a common redux store without meddling with each other's state).
====



== Client-side rendering

In this example we'll create another part, similar to <<Hello React>>, but with these variations:

* *Use client side rendering* with a `clientRender` flag, turning the entire output into client-side React component.
* *Renter into existing target element* which comes from a Thymeleaf template _before_ the entry is rendered into it.
* *Reuse the "hello-react" template* created in the <<Hello React>> examples
* *Insert editorial data* And use these through the props.

.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
site/parts/
  hello-react/
    hello-react.jsx
  client-render/
    client-render.xml
    client-render.html
    client-render.es6
----



=== Code

*The part definition* is still pretty unremarkable.
Only now there's a `greetee` TextLine input field ready for some editorial text from Content Studio.

.client-render.xml:
[source,xml,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<part>
	<display-name>Client Rendering</display-name>
    <description>Client-side rendered react component</description>
	<form>
        <input name="greetee" type="TextLine">
            <label>Who or what should we greet?</label>
            <occurrences minimum="1" maximum="1"/>
            <default>world</default>
        </input>
    </form>
</part>
----

*The thymeleaf template* shows that a target container element can be anywhere in an HTML body - same as in vanilla react - as long as we point to it with a unique element ID. Here: `"second-example-container"`.

.client-render.html
[source,html,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<div class="clientrender-example">
    <h2>Client-side rendering example</h2>
    <p>Skips server-side rendering, and instead sets up client-side react to render the entry into the container below:</p>
    <div id="second-example-container"></div>
    <p>(And we're done)</p>
</div>
----

TIP: We've hardcoded the ID here and in the controller for clarity. The best practice however, would be to pass it to thymeleaf through the model - see <<Custom flow>>.

Moving on to *the part controller*, where the React4xp stuff happens:

.client-render.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----

const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');
const thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

const view = resolve('client-render.html'); <!--1-->

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const preExistingBody = thymeleaf.render(view, {}); <!--1-->

    const props = {
        greetee: component.config.greetee <!--2-->
    };

    const params = {
        <!--3-->
        body: preExistingBody,
        id: 'second-example-container',
        clientRender: true,
    };

    const jsxPath = 'site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'; <!--4-->

    return React4xp.render(jsxPath, props, request, params);
----

What's happening here?

<1> The HTML with the target container element is rendered,
<2> We get the `greetee` value from XP and insert in into the props,
<3> We're adding some *parameters* as a fourth argument object to `.render`:
  * `body` is the HTML body we're inserting the React entry into,
  * `id` is setting the ID, and targeting that container element in `body`,
    - A side note: in the first example, we didn't pass an `id` or a `body` parameter to `.render`, but it still worked. *They are both optional*, React4XP generates what's missing: If no `body` is found, React4xp will generate an empty HTML with a matching element ID. If there's no `id` found either, a random number is used - or data from `component` if you used that in the entry argument. If there's a `body` but it doesn't have any elements with an ID matching the `id` parameter, an empty target container element is added at the end of `body`.
  * `clientRender`: if this is truthy, you get old-school client-side React rendering. `.render` doesn't render the entry on the server-side, but leaves the target container unchanged and instead makes some page contributions that makes the browser build the entry into the target container.
  * There's also an optional `pageContributions` field, for adding pre-existing page contributions to the ones that `.render` generates.

<4> Here an important concept is introduced - the _jsxPath_:

=== JsxPath

*A _jsxPath_ is the name of an entry in React4xp*. Remember how we used the `component` object to refer to the entry in the first example, which is the easiest way but _only works if the entry is in the same folder and has the same name_. Here we want to access the entry (the same entry we used before) from a different part's folder - from _anywhere_ actually. JsxPaths are _name strings_, not paths relative to the controller (so avoid `../` etc).

*Rules of thumb for jsxPaths:*

* If an entry file is a JSX file under `src/main/resources/site`, the jsxPath is the file path relative to `src/main/resources/` - unix-style and without file extension.
* An entry can also be located under `src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries`, and then the jsxPath will be relative to that folder instead.
* If you're ever unsure: all the available jsxPaths are stored in `build/resources/main/assets/react4xp/entries.json`. This file is generated by webpack during build (and shouldn't be deleted or edited).



*Okay, enough - time to run the example!*

=== Setup

- The new part is ready. Add it to some content in Content Studio, the same way you did in <<Client-side rendering>>.
- Change the part's `greetee` field: edit the content, click and mark the "Client-side rendering example" part, and edit the "Who or what should we greet?" field on the right-side config panel. When you save it, the preview should update.

[.thumb]
image::editing-clientside.png["Changing props editorially in Content Studio",width=1037px]


=== Output

If we open a Preview tab and dig into *the output page source*, it's similar to the previous example:
[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<body>
  <main data-portal-region="main" class="xp-region">

    <div class="clientrender-example">
      <h2>Client-side rendering example</h2>
      <p>Skips server-side rendering, and instead sets up client-side react to render the entry into the container below:</p>
      <div id="serverside-example-container"></div> <!--1-->
      <p>(And we're done).</p>
    </div>

  </main>

  <script src="(...) /react4xp/externals.88e80cab5.js" ></script>
  <script src="(...) /react4xp-client/" ></script>
  <script src="(...) /react4xp/site/parts/hello-react/hello-react.js"></script> <!--2-->
  <script defer> <!--3-->
    React4xp.CLIENT.render(
        React4xp['site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'],
        "second-example-container" ,
        {
            "greetee":"from the client side",
            "react4xpId":"second-example-container"
        }
    );
  </script>
</body>
----

Most notable differences from the first example:

<1> The target container is now initially empty, there was no rendered HTML from the server.
<2> The imported entry is still the same as in the previous example. This is the compiled version of the JSX component we pointed to with `jsxPath` in the controller.
<3> Instead of `.hydrate`, we're calling `.render`. Our react component is rendered and inserted into the `"serverside-example-container"` element _by the browser_. `React4xp.CLIENT.render` has the same signature as `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate`: `(entryJsxPath, targetElementId, props)`.





== Custom flow

In this example we won't use `.render`.
Instead, we'll look at a more direct syntax that gives you better control and opportunities for logic steps when you handle the entry.

We'll construct *a data-holding React4xp object* from an entry, manipulate it a little,
and use its built-in methods to render the `body` and the `pageContributions` separately.

Other features demonstrated:

* The target container ID is inserted into `body` by Thymeleaf, which gets it from the data-holding object
* Using an entry outside of XP's `/site/` structure, in the base directory `/react4xp/_entries`
* Making some raw XP page contributions before rendering, with a script with inserted editorial data. Then passing that `pageContributions` object through `.renderPageContributions`, adding it to the React4XP page contributions

=== Code

*The part definition* now defines some other editorial data: `color`.

.custom-flow.xml:

<part>
  <display-name>Custom Flow</display-name>
  <description>React4xp object syntax, and more</description>

  </form>
</part>

*The react component* is inline-styled with the color it gets from the `props`:

.ColorThing.jsx:
[source,JavaScript]
----
import React from 'react';

export default (props) =>
  <div style={{border: `1px dotted ${props.color}`,margin:"5px",padding:"5px" }}>
    <h2>The {props.color} thing</h2>
    <p style={{color: props.color}}>Hey, I'm pretty {props.color}!</p>
  </div>;
----

*The Thymeleaf view* receives the ID of the target container element from Thymeleaf:


.custom-flow.html
[source,html]
----
<div>
    <p>Here comes the thing:</p>
    <div data-th-id="${targetId}"></div>

Finally, the controller:

.custom-flow.es6
[source,JavaScript]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');
const thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');

const view = resolve('custom-flow.html');

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const reactObj = new React4xp('ColorThing'); <!--1-->

    reactObj
        .setProps({ color: component.config.color })
        .uniqueId(); <!--2-->

    const model = {
        targetId: reactObj.react4xpId <!--3-->
    };
    const preRenderedBody = thymeleaf.render(view, model);

    const preExistingPageContributions = {
        bodyEnd: `<script>
        	console.log('Okay, rendered the ${reactObj.props.color} thing.');
        		</script>`
    }; <!--3-->

    return { <!--4-->

        body: reactObj.renderBody({
            body: preRenderedBody, <!--5-->
        }),

        pageContributions: (request.mode === 'live' || request.mode === 'preview') ? <!--6-->
            reactObj.renderPageContributions({ <!--7-->

            }) :
            undefined
    }
};
----


<1> Constructing the data-holding React4XP object `reactObj`. The constructor takes *one mandatory argument*: an entry reference. Just like the first argument in `.render`, the entry reference can be a jsxPath OR an XP component object. Here it's a jsxPath. So why is `ColorThing`, and _only_ that, the jsxPath to `ColorThing.jsx`? Because the JSX file is at the root level of the React4XP _entries base folder_: `src/main/resources/react4xp/_entries`.
<2> The React4XP object has setter methods that return the object itself, so you can set any optional attributes with a chained builder pattern like in the example, or separately. The uniqueId() method forces the ID of the object and the target container element to be unique. If an object doesn't have an ID, this will be called by default when rendering (so we could have just skipped it here). The order of the setter methods doesn't matter. This example is equivalent to:
	reactObj.setProps({color: component.config.color});
	reactObj.uniqueId();
<3> We can read attributes from `reactObj` before the rendering. At this point, the ID (`react4xpId`) and `props` are set in it. We read them out and injecting them into the thymeleaf model and into some random page contributions.
<4> Here, `body` and `pageContributions` are rendered separately (`renderBody` and `renderPageContributions`). Remember that this is different from `.render` which does everything in one go.
<5> The Thymeleaf-rendered `body` is given to `.renderBody`, which will insert react into that HTML. Again, the `body` parameter is optional - if we don't submit it `.renderBody` will just generate a target container for you, with a matching ID.
<6> The other difference from `.render`: _there's no automatic selection of rendering mode here_. If we want to *avoid active client-side JS running in Content Studio's _edit_ and _inline_ modes*, we now need to do it manually: detect the viewing mode from the `request` object and just skip the pageContributions.
<7> We render the necessary page contributions for activating the entry, and pass `preExistingPageContributions` through `.renderPageContributions` - just adding it to the rendered page contributions. The `pageContributions` parameter is optional.

[NOTE]
====
Just like the `.render` method in examples 01 and 02, we can control `.renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions` with the `clientRender` parameter. In this example, we called them both without it (so `body` is rendered on the server-side into the HTML, and `.hydrate` is called on the body in the client, instead of `.render`).
The `clientRender` parameter *should match between the two rendering functions* for a React4XP object: if we add it to `.renderBody` (and it's true/truthy), we should add it to `.renderPageContributions` too.
====

*Okay, let's take a look!*


=== Setup

Like before, open Enonic XP Content Studio, add the new part to some content, select and edit it and change the Color of the Thing, for example to "blue".

Save, it should look something like this:

[.thumb]
image::the-blue-thing2.png["Rendered text in Content Studio is blue, and says: the blue thing" width=1068px]


=== Output

If we open it in Preview and look at the browser console, we also see that the little `console.log` script from the controller has picked up the `color` prop from the React4XP object:

[.thumb]
image::the-blue-thing.png["Rendered preview looks the same as in Content Studio, but now we also see that the expected output was printed in the browser console." width=1068px]


*The output page source* should similar to this (and similar to what `.render` generated earlier):

[source,html,options="nowrap"]
----
<body>
    <main data-portal-region="main" class="xp-region">

        <div data-portal-component-type="part">
            <p>Here comes the thing:</p>
            <div></div>
            <div id="_99689402">
                <div style="border:1px dotted blue;margin:5px;padding:5px" data-reactroot="">
                    <h2>The <!-- -->blue<!-- --> thing</h2>
                    <p style="color:blue">Hey, I'm pretty <!-- -->blue<!-- --> !</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

    </main>
    <script src="(...) react4xp/externals.88e80cab5.js"></script>
    <script src="(...) react4xp-client/"></script>

    <script>console.log('Okay, rendered the blue thing.');</script>

    <script src="(...) react4xp/ColorThing.js"></script>
    <script defer>React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate(React4xp['ColorThing'], "_99689402", {
        "color": "blue",
        "react4xpId": "_99689402"
    });</script>
</body>
----

NOTE: the random but matching ID (_uniqueId_) of the target container and in the `React4xp.CLIENT.hydrate` call.


== Chaining

Demonstrating some final features:

- We'll stay with the syntax from the previous example, and that lets us make *a part with multiple entries* - both different entries and reusing multiple instances of the same entry.
  * *Chaining:* We'll see how rendered bodies and page contributions are passed through all the entries, before returning the final `body` and `pageContribution` to the response object.
- Importing other React components into your entries - both other entries and React components from dependency *chunks*:
  * Webpack compiles and packs code into "sub-libraries", for bundling up and optimizing code that's frequently imported by other entries (or chunks).

Obviously, this is gonna be the most complex example. Also, some of the React components in this example will be _stateful and active_ on the client (this doesn't really demonstate anything - active components don't require anything special from React4XP, we've just been using passive components until now).


.Files involved:
[source,files]
----
react4xp/
  _entries/
    mySubfolder/ <!--1-->
      BuilderClickerEntry.jsx
  myChunk/ <!--2-->
    BuilderClicker.jsx
site/parts:
  /chaining/
    chaining.jsx
    chaining.xml
    chaining.html
    chaining.es6
----

Just make a mental note of a difference from before - *two added subfolders:*

<1> `mySubfolder` under `react4xp/_entries/`
<2> `myChunk` under `react4xp/`

They are important in two ways, we'll see how in a moment.


=== Code

The first entry:

.react4xp/_entries/mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry.jsx:
[source,JavaScript]
----
import React from 'react';

import BuilderClicker from '../../myChunk/BuilderClicker';

export default (props) => <div className="builderclicker-entry">
		<BuilderClicker {...props} />
	</div>;
----

Some repetition from before: remember how *JSX files below `react4xp/_entries` will be compiled to entries, with a jsxPath relative to that folder and without the file extension*? So this will be an entry with the jsxPath `mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry`.

It's functionally pretty slim, it doesn't do much except import another React component, `react4xp/myChunk/BuilderClicker` and pass the props down to it. Since `BuilderClicker` is not under `react4xp/_entries`, it's not an entry and can't be used by React4XP. Which is why it needs an entry like this.


*A slightly heavier, non-entry React component:*

.react4xp/myChunk/BuilderClicker.jsx:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';

class BuilderClicker extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.state = {
            first: props.first,
            second: props.second,
        }
    };

    // Doubles the 'first' or 'second' string in state, depending on the key.
    makeMore = (key) => {
        this.setState({[key]: this.state[key] + " " + this.state[key]});
    };

    render() {
        return <div className="builderclicker">
            <h3 style={{color:"green"}}>
                <span onClick={() => this.makeMore('first')}
                      style={{cursor: "pointer"}}
                      className="first">{this.state.first}
                </span> <span onClick={() => this.makeMore('second')}
                      style={{cursor: "pointer"}}
                      className="second">{this.state.second}</span>
            </h3>
        </div>;
    }
};

export default (props) => <BuilderClicker {...props} />;
----


`BuilderClicker` displays two texts in one line, and builds more by doubling each of the texts whenever they are clicked in the browser.

This is a _non-entry_ React component, that will be imported by several of the entries in this example (`BuilderClickerEntry` is one of them). Because of its source file location, `BuilderClicker` will be compiled into a highly reuseable, optimized and auto-handled chunk called `myChunk`:

==== Chunks:


*JSX files that are _not_ under `site/` or `react4xp/_entries` won't be compiled into entries*. They don't have a jsxPath, and *need to be imported by an entry* to be used in React4XP (or to be precise: they must be part of an import tree with an entry on top).

*Everything that's imported from files in other subfolders below `react4xp/` will be compiled into chunks*. These are "sub-library" code bundles with the same name as the subfolder. They are *optimized* for repeated loading and runtime import, and cached for reuse, with a cache-busting content hash added to the file name.

Chunks are made to be *fire-and-forget:* you don't need to handle them in any way after naming the subfolders and importing the contents correctly. React4xp takes care of them during serving, caching and server-side rendering.

One recommended usage - an entry as a bridge between React4xp and more heavyweight React components:

[TIP]
====
*Since the chunks are most optimized, it's recommended to keep the entries slim and put as much of the heavy and reusable stuff as possible into chunks.* Also, it's best to keep the non-entries in chunks: each JSX entry is compiled to its own separate JS file. If an entry imports a non-entry piece of code that's _not in a chunk either_, it will just be compiled into the entry's JS "bundle", making it more heavy-weight.
====


*Another entry in the part:*

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.jsx:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
import React from 'react';
import BuilderClickerEntry from '../../../react4xp/_entries/mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry';

export default (props) => <BuilderClickerEntry {...props} />;
----

Three things to note here:

* An entry can import and nest another entry just fine (if you should ever need to),
* The same React component, `BuilderClicker`, is imported from its chunk more than once in the same part (but only loaded once in the client),
* The two instances of it are functional and independent in the client. The fact that it's imported into the part through two different entries doesn't matter for this - we'll show this by using _this_ entry twice in the controller.


*The part definition* doesn't define anything editorial this time:

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.xml:
[source,xml]
----
<part>
  <display-name>Chaining</display-name>
  <description>Multiple react components, chaining, nesting, hydration</description>
  <form />
</part>
----


*The part view* has two target containers (with hardcoded IDs) and a horizontal divider, and clearly expects some more containers to be added:

.site/parts/chaining/chaining.html:
[source,html,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
<div class="chaining-example">
    <h1>04 - Chaining Example</h1>
    <p>These two target containers existed in the HTML:</p>
    <div id="a-target-container"></div>
    <div id="another-target-container"></div>

    <hr style="display:block; margin:20px; width:100%; height:1px; border:1px dotted #aaa;"/>
    <p>The rest of the containers don't exist before rendering, but are inserted at the end:</p>
</div>
----


And finally, the juicy part controller:


.site/parts/chaining/chaining.es6:
[source,javascript,linenums,options="nowrap"]
----
const portal = require('/lib/xp/portal');
const thymeleaf = require('/lib/thymeleaf');
const React4xp = require('/lib/enonic/react4xp');

const view = resolve("chaining.html");

exports.get = function(request) {
    const component = portal.getComponent();

    const clientRender = (request.mode !== 'edit' && request.mode !== 'inline'); <!--1-->


    const firstReact4xpObj = new React4xp('mySubfolder/BuilderClickerEntry') <!--2-->
        .setId("a-target-container")
        .setProps({
            first: "Click",
            second: "ME!"
        });

    const secondReact4xpObj = new React4xp(component) <!--3-->
        .setId("another-target-container")
        .setProps({
            first: "No click ME!",
            second: "I do the exact same thing only better!"
        });

    // ------------------------------ A horizontal separator comes here in the view:
    // a new section where React4XP generates and inserts target containers where the
    // IDs didn't exist in the HTML


    const thirdReact4xpObj = new React4xp(component) <!--4-->
        .setId("a-third-container-doesnt-exist-but-will-be-generated") <!--5-->
        .setProps({
            first: "Here I am.",
            second: "Again."
        });


    let body = thymeleaf.render(view, {});

    body = firstReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body }); <!--6-->
    body = secondReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body, clientRender });
    body = thirdReact4xpObj.renderBody({ body });

    let pageContributions = firstReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions();
    pageContributions = secondReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions({
    	pageContributions,
    	clientRender
    });
    pageContributions = thirdReact4xpObj.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });


    ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].forEach(cardinalNum => {	<!--7-->
        const notUniqueComp = new React4xp(
            	'site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'
            )
            .setId('this-is-not-unique')
            .setProps({ greetee: `${cardinalNum} repeated thing`});

        body = notUniqueComp.renderBody({ body });
        pageContributions = notUniqueComp.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });
    });


    ['first', 'second', 'third', 'fourth'].forEach(cardinalNum => {
        const uniqueComp = new React4xp(
            	'site/parts/hello-react/hello-react'
            )
            .setId('this-id-is-unique').uniqueId() <!--8-->
            .setProps({ greetee: `${cardinalNum} unique thing`});

        body = uniqueComp.renderBody({body});
        pageContributions = uniqueComp.renderPageContributions({ pageContributions });
    });


    return { <!--9-->
        body,
        pageContributions: clientRender ?
            pageContributions :
            undefined,
    };
};

----


<1> *Content Studion and client-side rendering/hydration:* Just like we did in the previous example, it's a good idea to respond to XP's viewing mode: are the react components being displayed inside Content Studio (request.mode is 'edit' or 'inline')? If so, the client-side JS of Content  Studio may clash with react's JS. We're making a boolean `clientRender` for common control of all the entries in this part. This allows client-side rendering and hydration only outside Content Studio, and makes React4xp render static and un-hydrated HTML visualizations inside Content Studio - giving a visualization everywhere but activation only outside of Content Studio. Repetition: the `React4xp.render` shorthand function does all this automatically, if you prefer that.
<2> Importing `BuilderClicker` from `myChunk` a first time, through `BuilderClickerEntry`...
<3> ...and a sceond time, through the part's own entry (referred by `component`) which nests `BuilderClickerEntry`...
<4> ...and a third time, through the same part's own entry again.
<5> From here on down, none of the IDs will exist as target element IDs in the body. React4XP auto-handles this by inserting them at the end of `body`, in the order of chaining:
<6> *Chaining:* First creates a `body` starting point from the local Thymeleaf template. This is _passed through_ the `.renderBody` method of all the React4XP objects, each one expanding `body` by inserting either just a container element (`clientRender`) or rendering more React into it. `firstReact4xpObj` and `thirdReact4xpObj` will be server-side-rendered, `secondReact4xpObj` will be client-side-rendered. Note how *the `clientRender` parameter matches for each React4XP object*, between the `renderBody` and `.renderPageContributions` calls in the next step. `.renderPageContributions` works the same way: a `pageContributions` object is expanded with activating scripts for each time it passes through a React4XP object. `.renderPageContributions` only appends what's necessary, so that shared components and chunks etc aren't loaded more than once in the client.
<7> Making 4 unique React4XP objects from the same entry, with different props, and adding them to the chain. _They all have the same ID_ (`'this-is-not-unique'`), so they will be rendered and overwritten into the same container element - so only the last one of them survives and is visible.
<8>	So the lesson is to force the IDs to be unique, by adding a `.uniqueId()` call in each iteration. Now that the IDs are different, and they each get their own container element and all four are visibly rendered.
<9> And finally, outputting the results of the chain (although the pageContributions are skipped inside Content Studio).

[NOTE]
====
In this example we're making a new React4xp object for each rendering. An object can in principle be re-rendered, *but rendering a body or pageContribution will lock the ID* of the object.

In other words: we can use an _entry_ multiple times target1ing different container elements by using different React4XP objects. And we can render the same _React4XP object_ into the same container multiple times (if we should need to). But *trying to change the ID and target element will throw an error after an object's first rendering.*
====

=== Setup


Add this part the same way as in the previous examples and look at it in the Preview - you should see this:

[.thumb]
image::chaining2.png["You clicked, Sir? I am but a humble screenshot!" width=1036px]

The few things worth confirming here:

* A *many-to-many relationship*: all of the entries and React4xp objects were visualized by a single part here. And some of the entries have been used in other parts and across several React4xp objects.
* This is but a humble screenshot, but in the actual Preview outside of Content Studio, the green rendered `BuilderClicker` instances are now *active* and respond to clicks as defined in `BuilderClicker`: clicking the first or second half of each of them doubles the clicked text (this activation happened in the `.hydrate` steps for server-side rendered entries, and in the actual rendering for client-side rendered ones).
* The clicks and reponses are *isolated* to the instance that was actually clicked: even though they are technically the same entry `BuilderClicker`, they each have their own state. This is not because `BuilderClicker` is nested differently in them, but because their ID's are different,
* There's only one "...repeated thing" but four "...unique thing", as explained above (point 7 and 8 in the controller code)

=== Output

*The output page source* to the client is much longer now. If you want to dive into that, it would look something like this:

Just confirming what you surely guessed would happen:

<1> While the first and third React4XP objects were server-side rendered and hydrated, the second one was client-side rendered into an empty container.
<2> Several of the containers that were output weren't defined in the original Thymeleaf template, and were only rendered because the ID wasn't found.
<3> Only one container with _"this-is-not-unique"_ was rendered for the same reason: that ID had already been inserted. So all the corresponding React4XP objects were server-side rendered into that one. This would also happen with client-side rendering! Also look further down: the client is asked to `hydrate` all four instances, which will log errors in the console since the content doesn't match.
<4> React4xp automatically traced the dependency to `myChunk.<hash>.js` and added this import to the page contributions because that's where `BuilderClicker` comes from.
<5> Although several of the generated assets are _used_ more than once, the page contributions are trimmed for duplicates so each of them are only _downloaded to the client_ once.


== Need to go deeper?

Thats _most_ of what React4XP offers. For more technical details, some corner-case features, adaptability and more complex functionality, we will shortly release on the Enonic pages a full API overview and other in-depth documentation for the library and build setup.
