=== Overrides file

The path for the webpack overrides file is hardcoded to
<Project.Dir>/webpack.config.react4xp.js

NOTE: It is only used when building components.

There should be an updated example file in the @enonic/react4xp package under examples/webpack.config.react4xp.js

=== Cache

To improve the speed of incremental builds, you may use webpack caching.

Read more here: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/cache/

Example:

.<Project.Dir>/webpack.config.react4xp.js
[source,javascript,options="nowrap"]
----
module.exports = function(env, config) {

	if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
		config.cache = {
			type: 'filesystem'
		}
	}

	return config;
};
