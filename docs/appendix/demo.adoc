== What?
You will run an XP server with a sample dataset, then deploy a R4XP front-end on top of it

TIP: Want to learn what is really happening? Head on to the <<enonic-setup#, first chapter>> of the tutorial instead.

== 1 - Create a sandbox

*Create a sandbox* run the following command in your terminal:

 enonic sandbox create r4xpdemo -t hmdb -f

== 2 - Create application

From a *new terminal window*, run the following command:

 enonic project create my.first.r4xp -r tutorial-react4xp -b issue-77 -s r4xpdemo -f

== 3 - Build and deploy

 enonic project gradle build deploy

== 1 - Setup Enonic

. **Sign up for a free Enonic account**: on https://www.enonic.com/sign-up
. After logging in to your account, **create a new solution** from `Solutions -> Create -> Next.js Demo`. This will install all required Enonic apps and setup the routes needed. 
. From your new solution, click `Environments` - Notice the URL to the `API` ingress, you will need it later.

== 3 - Install the Front-end
TODO

== 4 - Activate preview
With the front-end running, it is time to enable preview in Content Studio.

The fastest way to try it out goes as follows:

. **Launch Enonic XP admin** from the solution dashboard.
. **Open Content Studio** from the top right `XP menu -> Content Studio`.
. Choose the `Headless Movie DB` project, then click the root item in the tree structure `/hmdb` and click `Edit`.

+
. Add the `Next.XP` app to the list of applications on the site.
It will override the default preview for the content within the site.
+

+
. Now, instruct Next.XP where to find the frontend server:
+
.Go to Applications tab in Enonic Cloud and select Next.XP app:

+
.Press `Edit...` button in the app context menu and add the URL and secret of the Vercel app you deployed in step 3:

+
NOTE: We are overriding default preview configuration for all sites using the Next.XP app. Use a different keyword than `default` to define multiple front-ends.
+
. After saving and going back to Content Studio, the preview should update to show your front-end.

== How does it work?
The Front-end app steps into the Site Engine pipeline and replaces HMDB's standard preview.

Congratulations, you now have a React site powered by Enonic! ðŸš€
