Standard configuration options for your React4XP-based application

Like any other Enonic application, you may provide a standard configuration file, and place in in the XP config folder. i.e. $XP_HOME/config/<app.name>.cfg

== R4XP tuning
The React4XP starter provies a few standard configuration options (in addition to the configuration options you define yourself). Here they are:


.myr4xpapp.cfg
[source,properties]
----
react4xp.hydrate = (true|false) // <1>
react4xp.ssr = (true|false) // <2>
# react4xp.ssr.maxThreads = (int) // <3>
react4xp.serveGlobals = true // <4>
react4xp.urlType = server|absolute // <5>
----

<1> Set `hydrate` to `false` to disable hydration
<2> Set `ssr` to `false` in order to disable SSR by default. This setting can be overridden on a per-component basis in your code.
<3> `maxThreads` specifies the number of (<<api#renderers, renderers>>) used for simultaneous SSR requests. Defaults to the number of processors cores available to XP. Be careful about setting this option
<4>  React4xp creates a globals bundle, which MUST contain all assets NEEDED to render server-side. By default it contains react and react-dom, but more assets can be added. By default the globals bundle is also provided to the client-side, setting `serveGlobals` to `false` will prevent globals from being delivered to the client.
+
NOTE: Keep in mind the assets in the globals bundle are still REQUIRED for
clientSide rendering to work, so you have to provide those assets by other
means, for example via CDN.
<5> `urlType` may optionally be used to force generation of `absolute` URLs. The default value is `server`

NOTE: This feature was introduced in `React4XP-5.1.0`
